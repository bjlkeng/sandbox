{"title": "2022 Year-In-Review", "content": "2022 Year-In-Review\n\t\t\n\nThankfully 2022 has felt a bit more like a \u201cnormal\u201d year.  I saw \nslightly\n more people in person, got into a groove at work, and continued to play and have fun with my daughter.  It\u2019s not quite like it was before the pandemic but it doesn\u2019t feel strange anymore.  It\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019s because I\u2019m getting used to this new environment, or if it is actually getting back to normal.  Like most things, it\u2019s probably a mix of both.\n\n\n\n\n\nPandemic notwithstanding, this year had fewer really big changes compared to the last couple of years, which is a really nice change.  It feels good to get into a groove where I can start to feel productive in many different areas of my life.  This is a lot harder when things are changing fast where I\u2019m forced to constantly rebalance different parts of my life.  A calm year, like this past one, gives me more time to think and reflect on things, two activities I really enjoy doing.  I\u2019ve included some of those reflections in this review for posterity.  Enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily: \nAs anyone with young kids can attest, they take up \nlots\n of time.  From those who haven\u2019t experienced this joy, it may seem like a big loss.  You have less time for everything.  Friends, side projects, TV, going out, you name it.  But on the other hand, the joy you get from playing with your child is infinitely better.  Let me attempt to explain.\n\n\n\n\n\nA good (math) metaphor I was thinking about: imagine your happiness can be modelled as a rectangle on a two dimensional plane.  The area of the rectangle is your happiness from all your non-child activities e.g., friends, going out, etc.  Once you have a child, this area shrinks.  You no longer have much time for any of those things.  No drinks with friends, no going out to the movies, drastically reduced TV time etc.  BUT\u2026 what happens when you have a child is that a whole new dimension of happiness opens up with it being measured by the time spent with your child.  Your happiness is no longer measured by area but by \nvolume\n.  So in some sense (projecting onto the two dimensional plane), your life is worse off.  But when measuring using \nvolume\n, your life is infinitely more rich.  Not a perfect analogy but it gives you a sense of the phenomenon.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther than the standard things one does with a toddler, not much has changed on the family side.  Just enjoying all of it.  We\u2019ve been spending a bit more time with the extended family too as COVID worries wane and hope to do more of it next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nFriends:\n I\u2019ve been terrible at keeping in touch with my friends these past couple of years.  I use the excuse of not being able to meet in-person combined with having a small child, but that\u2019s a weak excuse.  Recently, I\u2019ve been trying to get in touch with some of my friends now that I\u2019m more comfortable with limited in-person meetings.  I hope I can do more of it next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth & Fitness:\n On the health side, through the first half of the year, I continued to lose a bit of weight and in the last half of the year plateaued.  To be honest, I\u2019ve relaxed some of my weight loss efforts because I\u2019m already at an acceptable weight (but who wouldn\u2019t want to lose another 5 lbs?).  The good thing is that I think I\u2019ve successfully adopted a lot of habits that will keep the weight off, namely, eating a lot less per meal and little, if any, binge eating.  We\u2019ll see if it sticks when I (hopefully) start going out to eat at restaurants next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the fitness side, I\u2019ve done little to nothing.  Even though I have a home gym downstairs, it has seen little use.  The main problem is that with the little free time that I have (not playing with my daughter), I am just not prioritizing fitness (for example, I\u2019d often rather be writing).  Hopefully I\u2019ll get some free time back as my daughter gets older.\n\n\n\n\n\nHobbies\n: On the hobby side, as with last year, not much progress on either music or Chinese.  On the music side, my main practice has been playing and singing with my daughter, which is one of the main reasons why I learned to sing in the first place.  It\u2019s wonderful to be able to share it with my daughter, and she sings surprisingly well for a toddler.  As for Chinese, I\u2019m still doing biweekly lessons but progress is slow and proportional to how much I put in, which as you might guess is not much.  Still, it helps to have a refresher periodically, which is at least some maintenance.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the blogging side, I\u2019ve written nothing on this site (except this post), but have published two posts on my \ntechnical blog\n.  One of them was a monster post on stochastic calculus, which I\u2019m quite proud of since it required a huge amount of learning on my part.  I also have one in progress now that hopefully will go out soon, so maybe we can count that as two and a half.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional\n\n\n\n\n\nBorealis:\n I\u2019m roughly a year and a half into my tenure as a Research Director at Borealis and I\u2019m enjoying it.  The people are smart, I\u2019m doing some interesting AI work, and the work-life balance is good.  Not much more to say except that it reminds me of the Tolstoy quote: \nHappy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nRotman:\n Similar situation at Rotman where I\u2019m a Data Scientist in Residence and an Adjunct Professor.  It\u2019s not too different than the last few years.  I recently realized that I\u2019m into my fifth year with Rotman \u2014 how time flies!  The biggest thing I\u2019m looking forward to is the current revision of my course (Deep Learning with Applications in Marketing \u2014 not the actual title).  I\u2019m including some topics that I haven\u2019t dug into much myself, so it gives me a chance to learn / review.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe only thing I\u2019ll say about having another half job with Rotman is that it is hard to balance my time (now that I have a toddler).  With so little time available, I really have to find time to fit in the Rotman work.  Right now I\u2019m at my limit \u2014 I am unlikely to take on additional side work for now.  Another way to put it is the marginal cost of my time is very high at this point.  The relevant question is: how much would someone have to pay me to spend ten less hours per week with my daughter?  It\u2019s pretty high.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with everyone else in the market, this year has been quite \ninteresting\n to say the least.  My investments (beside my house, which I don\u2019t really consider as an investment) are almost all in stocks.  I run a relatively concentrated portfolio with between 5-10 long term holdings where my largest holding is more than 25% (Berkshire Hathaway if you were wondering).  I would say I\u2019m an intermediate level value investor, not really that sophisticated but learning.  I\u2019ll just rattle off a few thoughts, mainly for myself, but may be interesting to others:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA downmarket humbles you.  Some of my investments have gone down more than 50% (thankfully my whole portfolio hasn\u2019t suffered as much).  The two holdings that are down more than 50% had \nalready\n dropped 25% from their all time high when I bought them!  It gives a lot of perspective to how overvalued (or undervalued) a company can be.  Markets are definitely not efficient (in the short term).\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly I had 30+% of my portfolio in cash leading up to 2020.  In 2020, I got lucky and picked up a bit during the big drop after lock downs, allocated a bit more to a couple of stocks that dropped in 2021 (which subsequently dropped a lot more in 2022), then did the same thing in the first half of 2022, finally, deploying most of the rest at the tail end of 2022.  Sitting at the end of year, almost all of those positions are down (except one or two of the most recent purchases).  We\u2019ll see if it\u2019s a slow or fast recovery, but that just goes to show you how hard it is to time the market.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the large paper losses, I\u2019m not too worried.  The one big advantage I have is that I\u2019m a patient investor.  I don\u2019t get too jittered when things go up or down.  I\u2019m happy to sit on my butt for a long time.  I will say it\u2019s a lot easier for me though because I have a good emergency fund, a steady job, and I\u2019m still in the accumulating phase.  It probably would be a lot harder if I was trying to live off my portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n\nI recently started listening to more business podcasts (which are generally easier to find time for compared to books).  The one realization that became extremely clear is that I don\u2019t really know that much about business, strategy etc.  An example of this is that when I read conference call transcripts, I understand (mostly) the detailed points but have trouble putting them together into a bigger picture.  I\u2019m learning \nslowly\n but the first step is acknowledging that I don\u2019t know.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong these lines, I\u2019ve historically eschewed investing in fast growth companies with little or no profit. The tough part is that most of the value is derived from very optimistic future growth, which is inherently difficult to predict. Still, there is good money to be made in this area. Most folks in technology are a lot more comfortable investing in these companies (although I have my doubts on how successful they are overall).  There\u2019s always talk about how investing in Amazon in the 2000s would have net you a gigantic win (but you would\u2019ve had a couple of lost decades investing in some of the other hot companies like Cisco).  So to this end, this year is the first time I\u2019ve invested in a high growth company that is barely profitable.  The margin of safety here is that it\u2019s 75% off its all time high, has a huge total addressable market, has amazing execution and culture, and should benefit from some secular trends.  Time will tell if this is the right call.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are a bunch of things that I\u2019ve collected over the year that probably could be blog posts on their own, but I don\u2019t really have time to write.  Instead, I\u2019m just going to jot them down here for posterity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Quality Time\n: On one of the podcasts I was listening to (forgot which one), I heard a really insightful comment that I had to write down (paraphrasing): \nThere is no quality time without spending lots of time.  You can only get quality if you spend lots of time.\n  This was in the context of kids and family (but probably applies to other relationships).  You need to spend a lot of time to be able to establish a relationship where you can actually get to \u201cquality time\u201d (however you define it).  You can\u2019t just spend an hour of \u201cquality time\u201d with your kid a week and expect it to be good enough.  Quality time implies lots of time.  Something I\u2019m trying to live by with my daughter.\n\n\n\n\n\nTradeoffs: \nLife is about trade offs \u2014 especially with time.  This is something that I learned early on in my engineering education.  There\u2019s rarely a right or wrong direction, just trade offs (although there are often \nobviously better\n choices along a certain axis).  We shouldn\u2019t lament that we cannot do everything we would like, rather be happy with the choices we made to prioritize the most important things in our lives, which will be different for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\nRich Life: \nI started to listen to the \u201c\nI Will Teach You To Be Rich\n\u201d podcast by Ramit Sethi.  It sounds a bit like a scam, but his material is pretty good (for beginners) in personal finance, and his insight into personal finance problems is deep.  I think he hits the nail on the head when he consistently emphasizes that most money problems are psychological (strongly held beliefs about money that we learned growing up), and not necessarily strategic nor tactical.  The one thing that struck a chord with me is how he challenges his wealthy listeners on what their \nrich life\n looks like.  Most people who are saving a lot, even those in the top 1%, can\u2019t describe \nwhat\n they would do with money to live a happier or more fulfilling life (aka a \u201crich life\u201d).  This resonated with me because that\u2019s pretty close to my mindset.\u00a0 Always focused on savings or investing, but for what?\u00a0 To retire early and do nothing all day?\u00a0 It made me realize that I have so many good things going on for me right now and that I should really just enjoy the ride.\u00a0 Hitting some artificial date for financial independence isn\u2019t going to help if I don\u2019t already know how to be happy with the extremely fortunate position I\u2019m currently in now.  So while I\u2019m still going to invest prudently, I\u2019m also going to make sure that I\u2019m living a \u201crich life\u201d for both today and tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\nBias:\n I would generally consider myself in the top decile or so in terms of being rational.  But it\u2019s so hard to avoid bias.  One case in point is that I invested a little into Meta (Facebook\u2019s parent) on a dip, and my view on Facebook has totally changed.  Previously, I had a minor disgust for what they do, their non-ethical use of data, and the negative effects it has on society (note: I don\u2019t use Facebook).  After investing (and doing a bit more research), I now see it as a slight positive to society.  I can see how valuable some of its services are, and how hard some of the problems they work on are (e.g. filtering hate speech etc.).  My previous ideas were probably too negative, and my current ideas are probably too positive.  But it\u2019s amazing how much of a swing I can have in bias just by having a minor stake in it.  A lesson for all of us on the inescapable effects of bias.\n\n\n\n\n\nNetworking:\n Networking, both professionally and even socially, has been something that I\u2019ve not done much of.  I\u2019m probably below average to those who are at equivalent place in their career.  One good short course that I found was Jordan Harbinger\u2019s \n6 Minute Networking\n, which provided a step-by-step way to reconnect within my network.  The way that I\u2019m thinking about it now is that I just need to get into the habit of connecting with people.  It\u2019s always something I wanted to do, and I often do enjoy seeing what folks are up to, but I just never really knew \nhow\n to do it.  This course is good because it clearly lays out how to do (and explains the reasoning).  It\u2019s free and easy to start (more difficult to keep up though, as with any habit), so it\u2019s definitely something I recommend.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey choices:\n I came across an idea that I\u2019ve seen multiple times: there are only a handful of key choices that can explain the bulk of your career / life trajectory.  A few that were incredibly impactful for me on the career side: attending University of Waterloo (versus University of Toronto), choosing my graduate school supervisor, and joining Rubikloud.  These were all really big forks in the road that led me to where I am.  Most of the other decisions I made along the way were not that impactful (although cumulatively probably important).  Interesting to reflect on these big decisions and imagine what other paths my life could have taken.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiet:\n Something that I learned about myself is that how well I eat depends so much on how well I\u2019m feeling, which includes sleep and mood.  Eating junk food is definitely one of the ways I comfort myself and the best thing I can do to lose weight is to make sure that I\u2019m feeling physically and mentally well.  Easier said then done, but it does give me another mental model to think about how to adjust my lifestyle to achieve my health goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Next Year\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite all the craziness going on in the world, I\u2019m actually feeling optimistic about 2023.  I can see a path towards more \u201cnormal\u201d interactions where I can sit down with friends and extended family to eat a meal, have my daughter play with other kids, and do \nmost\n of the things that I was doing pre-pandemic.  Beyond this, all of the main parts of my life are pretty stable (after a couple year of upheaval), which will allow me to better optimize for some of my goals (e.g., learning, healthy, happiness etc.).  Of course I\u2019m sure 2023 will throw some curve balls my way, but it\u2019s a nice feeling to be looking to the new year with a renewed sense of optimism.  It\u2019s been a tough couple of years for everyone and I know not everyone has come out as well as I have, but I truly hope that 2023 will be brighter and more joyful for both you and me.\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2021 Year-In-Review\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2020 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2022/12/2022-year-in-review/"}
{"title": "2021 Year-In-Review", "content": "2021 Year-In-Review\n\t\t\n\nIt\u2019s been another strange year.  The global pandemic rages on and I\u2019m still stuck at home.  The scary part is that it\u2019s starting to feel like a new normal.  So much so that without vacations or social interactions, a lot of this year has flew by with many days blending into each other \u2014 something that is a little bit scary.  Perhaps one of the only things that helps stave off the monotony of this life is my daughter, who has progressed from infant to toddler along with all of the associated changes.  It\u2019s a joy to watch her learn and grow, and it makes \nmost\n days fun and enjoyable.  A few other important changes have shaken things up a bit as well but I still long for the days where I could go out, meet up with family and friends, and enjoy some good food and drink.  It\u2019ll come eventually but for now I\u2019ve lowered my expectations and instead I am trying to find balance within the current situation.  Life can be so unpredictable and strange but all we can do is choose how we react, and in my case I choose to make the most I can out of a global pandemic.  So with that, let\u2019s get on to the review!\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily:\n Almost all of my free time has been taken up raising my daughter, this is probably a very familiar experience to most new parents.  It\u2019s been such joy seeing her grow this past year.  There is a saying: \u201cwe are the average of the five people we spend the most time with\u201d, and without a doubt my daughter is one of the people I spend the most time with and has affected me in a dramatic way.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeing her delight in the simplest of acts somehow gives me a new perspective on life.  In many ways, most other things have decreased in importance.  Notwithstanding the pandemic, things that I used to do regularly such as going out to eat, hanging out with friends, or lazily sleeping in on the weekend are things that I still miss but not urgently.  I get more than enough entertainment and joy from playing with her (even when I\u2019m dead tired!).  In other areas such as work, I\u2019m less stressed than I was previously.  It\u2019s a bit easier for me to take a step back away because I have this totally different world (my daughter) that keeps me occupied.  Having said that, a bunch of new worries all related to my daughter are starting to surface starting with COVID.  As I understand that is only going to get worse as she grows up, but for now I\u2019ll do my best not to think too hard about all of those things.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an aside, one really cute thing I did on her birthday was write a letter to her.  It was an idea I got from somewhere on the interweb.  The idea is that you write a new letter each year and when she\u2019s an adult she can have some insight into her childhood and what it was like raising her.  Other things like journaling and taking lots of photos and videos are still things that I do, but probably not as often as I should.  It\u2019s a very unnatural habit that I never really picked up but it\u2019s never too late to start!\n\n\n\n\n\nStaying at Home\n: We\u2019ve been trying to keep extra safe taking many precautions and severely limiting outside contact.  We have frequent visits from the grandparents, less frequent visits from my siblings (and their kids), and maybe one or two visits from friends.  For my wife and me, this is fine because we have a really nice setup at home.  My main worry is about my daughter who hasn\u2019t had much interaction with other kids (or people).  She\u2019s still young so I\u2019m not too worried but parents will be parents.\n\n\n\n\n\nFriends:\n My only regret during this time has been that I\u2019ve been out of touch with many of my friends.  Part of it was expected because of the time with the baby, part of it was because I dislike socializing over virtual media.  I spend all day staring at a screen that the thought of spending more time in front of it to socialize seems unpleasant.  The few times that I have chatted with some friends virtually, it has been fun but those times have been few and far between.  Perhaps it\u2019s time to change my stance on it, in the back of my mind I\u2019ve been hoping for a return to normalcy but I should know that it\u2019s going to take longer than I think.\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth & Fitness:\n Due to the aforementioned lack of time, my fitness has really taken a hit.  Even before having kids it was challenging to find time to work out, but now it\u2019s taken a back seat to the other things (mainly my daughter) that come before it in priority.  I\u2019ve probably gone to the gym only a dozen times in the last year, and that is considering that I have a home gym in the basement!  The upside is that I get some light activity when I play with my daughter who loves running around the house but it\u2019s far from what I should be getting.  Hopefully as she gets older, it\u2019ll be easier to find some time to do more explicit exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\nApart from exercise, one achievement that I\u2019m quite proud of is managing my weight.  Over the past six months, I\u2019ve lost more than 10 lbs (average 1-2 lbs/month), which is the first time \never\n that I have intentionally lost weight!  Since the pandemic, I\u2019ve had pretty terrible eating habits and much less movement so I gained a bit of weight (maybe 5 lbs or so).  But since around June I decided to cut back.  What I\u2019ve found works is cutting back on sweets and generally eating less each meal.  At first it felt like I was under eating at each meal, but then I realized that my stomach doesn\u2019t signal my brain that it\u2019s full right away.  Moreover, I had the habit of drinking liquids \nafter\n I ate, which contributed to the delayed stomach-full signal.  My current rule of thumb is that my plate should look like it doesn\u2019t have a lot of food on it (based on my old standards).  Cutting sweets out was also tough since I have a big sweet tooth.  In general, I\u2019ve tried to substitute fruit in its place (sometimes several pieces), and when I do eat something unhealthy, I try to limit the portion instead of binging as I used to do.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe whole weight loss experience was pretty tough at first.  Some days I\u2019d revert to my old habits and overeat at dinner or have a bit too many sweets during the day, but the important part was just pick myself up and start eating healthier the next day.  My mindset was different from past attempts to cut back.  I wasn\u2019t trying to lose weight, I was instead trying to develop better habits.  The focus on trying to change behavior was the important part for me.  Another key aspect that worked for me is weighing myself almost everyday.  I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s generally not a good idea but I\u2019ve found it works incredibly well for the way my mind works.  Whenever I see my new weight, it helps me think back and try to \u201cexplain\u201d why my weight suddenly went up or down.  Over time, I\u2019ve started to develop an intuition of what will affect my weight, which in turn helps me make better choices during the day.  For me, this works much better than calorie counting which I\u2019ve found it hard to develop an intuition for. (Fun fact: Red meat and salty food are big confounders because they can add temporary weight over multi-day periods, while a \nreasonable\n portion of ice cream won\u2019t do too much damage.)  I hope this change in behavior is durable to get me down to my target weight.  I\u2019m the lightest that I\u2019ve been in the last 5 years and down a couple of belt notches too.  So far so good.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional\n\n\n\n\n\nBorealis:\n In July, I moved over from Kinaxis to Borealis AI.  Borealis AI is Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s industrial AI research lab.  At first, it seemed like an awkward place to have an AI lab given that most labs are part of some consumer facing tech company, but after thinking about it a bit more it makes a lot of sense.  On the one hand, traditional banks are getting disrupted from many different sides, evidenced by the numerous fintechs, so they need to adopt innovative technologies or risk falling behind (in the long term).  On the other hand, large banks (like RBC) have the scale to make small improvements matter.  In the same way that a slight improvement in Google\u2019s ad system can create tens of millions of dollars in value, adopting AI at scale in a large bank can also lead to some potentially high returns as well.  One hypothesis that I have is that you need this massive scale in order to make this type of industrial AI research lab viable (or I guess a never ending source of VC funding?).  Otherwise, it\u2019s difficult to justify the cost of hiring so many AI experts.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifically about Borealis though, I\u2019m quite happy with my experience so far.  All the people have been extremely friendly and welcoming, the hours and compensation are good, and most of all my background in leading large scale enterprise AI projects and organizations is providing a lot of value.  Borealis is \nmostly\n a separate organization within the bank, so we have lots of freedom in how we operate (relatively).  It feels like a small-ish (~100 people) organization and one where I can make a big impact.  This meshes well with my background at smaller startups and medium size companies (even though the greater RBC is massive).\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s still pretty early but I\u2019m enjoying my time there and I\u2019ve always had a background interest in finance.  Learning about all the various parts of what make a bank work is very interesting.  From personal banking to risk to capital markets, it\u2019s all very interesting to me.  Most of all, the team we have here is incredibly intelligent and working on state-of-the-art ML.  I\u2019m in the fortunate position that I have visibility in most of the projects that we do so there is a lot of learning by osmosis that happens (there\u2019s also a lot direct learning too).  The best part is that some of the ML topics that I\u2019ve been studying on my own have come up once or twice already at Borealis (including one of my technical blog posts someone at Borealis noticed even before hearing about me).  The dream is to be able to align the two worlds of personal interests and job.  Of course, it\u2019s not a perfect alignment (nor will it ever be) but I think it\u2019s a good start.\n\n\n\n\n\nRotman\n: I\u2019m continuing my role as an Adjunct Professor and Data Science in Residence at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto.  My main duties are in the Master\u2019s of Management Analytics program teaching a course of deep learning x marketing along with organizing several events.  I enjoy the teaching and interacting with students but maybe for an uncommon reason: it forces me to break down concepts into simple explanations that can be practically used.  This in turn helps me better understand the material.  I deeply enjoy this type of knowledge acquisition and it\u2019s also fun helping others understand it as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis past year was the first time I taught fully remote.  It\u2019s been a tough year for everyone but especially students. Outside of courses, a big part of the program is all the networking and other related events that go on, but all of those had to be held virtually.  Although the virtual events that have gone on are among the best I\u2019ve seen, ultimately they cannot replace face to face interactions.  Everyone is making the best out of a bad situation I guess.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy course delivered virtually worked out well since mostly of the course is lectures plus assignments and projects.  I also have some built-in interaction with students throughout my lectures so that forced \nsome\n engagement, but there\u2019s definitely something missing in terms of connection with students and, as a result, learning.  It\u2019s hard for the teacher\u2019s passion to come through virtually to movitate the students to learn, and it\u2019s these intangibles that are really lost.  I\u2019m slated to teach in person next year, but who knows what\u2019s going to happen with the pandemic.  Let\u2019s hope for the best.\n\n\n\n\n\nHobbies\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard to find time for hobbies when almost all your free time is spent hanging out with your kids!  In some sense, it\u2019s the ultimate \u201chobby\u201d that takes priority over all others.  Fortunately, my daughter\u2019s sleep has started to stabilize (sort of) over the past six months, so I have one or two hours at night before bed where I prioritize between chores, hobbies, and spending time with my wife.  Weekends are a total write-off because we\u2019re spending almost all our time with her (such a big contrast from before!).  One thing that all parents will tell you is how much more efficient they are with their time, that is definitely true for me.  With the little time I have, I have managed to do a few things listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\nReading:\n I haven\u2019t done much deep book reading lately.  It\u2019s primarily because it\u2019s hard for me to find a solid 15+ mins of time (ideally 30+ mins).  I\u2019ve probably only read a few books this year, mostly 5-10 pages at a time when I get a few quiet minutes.  The thing I think I\u2019m missing is finding a consistent time slot to do deep reading.  I\u2019m still searching but my schedule is changing every few months adapting to my daughter\u2019s schedule, so this still remains elusive.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne area that I have done more reading has been online newsletters send to my email.  There has been a boom of expertly written newsletters (some paid) that I\u2019m eagerly consuming.  These are easier to read because I can read them on my phone while having lunch, or while taking a short break from work.  These newsletters remind me very much of magazine articles in length and content that I used to read.  Nothing as well researched or deep as a good book, but at the same time they are much more substantial than most online news articles.  If an author has to read dozens of primary sources to write a single well researched book, these newsletter writers probably read one or two.  Still relatively well researched for the format and frequency.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nice thing about newsletters is that they are more timely than books but more well researched than newspaper articles (or worse social).  It\u2019s a really good trade-off in terms of time invested vs. benefit.  Additionally, these newsletters give me great perspectives on areas that I\u2019m interested in and want to learn more about (e.g. business, investing, finance).  Two of my favorites are \nMoney Stuff\n by Matt Levine and \nThe Diff\n by Byrne Hobart, both of which I highly recommend.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog:\n As you can see from my personal blog and \ntechnical blog\n, I\u2019ve hardly posted anything.  Most of my writing either occurs during the newly found hour or two at night or when I\u2019m on vacation and we have some extra help around the house to watch my daughter.  Even weekends, which used to be a great time to sit down for a couple of quiet hours, are now full-time parent duty.  Not that I\u2019m complaining, my prioritization of time has been good in retrospect.  I hope that as my daughter grows up, I\u2019ll find a bit more free time to write a bit more.  There\u2019s something very satisfying about writing that you don\u2019t often get in other activities.  For me, I think it\u2019s the combination of deep thinking (which I love to do) and creating something that really does it for me.  Hopefully I\u2019ll get more time to work on it going forward but I\u2019m okay with the current slow pace of progress for now.\n\n\n\n\n\nChinese\n: A goal that I\u2019ve had for a long time has been to become fluent in Chinese (Mandarin).  One of the main reasons was so that I could teach it to my kids.  Now that my daughter is learning a bit of it, I joke that my goal has shifted to becoming better than her at Chinese (which I am winning but to be fair, she\u2019s not even two years old)!  I picked up Chinese lessons again this year, shifting to private virtual lessons so that I could have more flexible hours.  I would estimate that my current status is barely maintaining my current level.  I\u2019ve found the only way to progress is to actually do the homework assignments, which I\u2019ve rarely done.  Having a lesson every week or two is barely enough to keep my language muscles working, but the past year has been quite the challenge in many different respects.  This is relatively low on my priority list so I\u2019m happy enough just maintaining baseline until I can free up a bit more time.\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic\n: I stopped music lessons during the pandemic.  Along with Chinese, it\u2019s relatively low on my priority list.  The only guitar I play nowadays is the few minutes when my daughter wants to hear it before she gets bored and moves on to the next toy.  On the flip side, I\u2019m doing much more singing but only of kids songs that my daughter wants to hear.  I\u2019m happy enough for now but, as most parents probably feel, I often long for the days when I had more free time to work on my hobbies.  That feeling quickly disappears though when I see my daughter running towards me shouting \u201cBaba\u201d (Dad in Chinese).\n\n\n\n\n\n2022 and Beyond\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not sure why but I have a lot fewer expectations of 2022.  It might be due to the long drawn out pandemic, it might be that I\u2019m becoming more like my daughter with a shorter attention span, or it just might be me maturing and becoming more of a stoic.  In either case, I don\u2019t have much time to have expectations.  Half of the time I\u2019m just trying to get through the day when I\u2019m dead tired, and the other half I\u2019m living in the moment playing with my daughter.  I guess this is what parenthood is all about.  For now, my mind is primarily on my family and I\u2019m quite happy with that.\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2020 Year-In-Review\n2022 Year-In-Review\n2018 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2021/12/2021-year-in-review/"}
{"title": "Humility", "content": "Humility\n\t\t\n\nBack in high school and undergrad, I was an excellent student: high marks, attended every class, and generally did what a model student ought to do.\n1\n  I was also pretty cocky \u2014 at least in the narrow domain of academic related things.  Although I didn\u2019t think myself as being smarter than others (just having a better system for school), I was pretty confident in my abilities to do well and wasn\u2019t afraid to let others know about it.\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen others were complaining about the workload, I assiduously did all the required work.  Other times they would complain about the poor teaching skills of the professors (especially in math-heavy courses), where I usually didn\u2019t have too much trouble following along (and where I did have trouble, I wrote everything down, went home to review the notes as required, which usually resolved things).  I once scored a perfect grade on a mid-term where the average was close to failing (and also had a perfect grade for a calculus course due to a 100% weighting of the final exam as an option).  It\u2019s not too difficult to see a young man who otherwise isn\u2019t very exemplary in other respects, cling onto the one thing that he excels at: academic excellence.  Cockiness aside, I\u2019m pretty sure I wasn\u2019t a jerk about it (I hope), I just didn\u2019t hide the fact that I didn\u2019t find things difficult as others, and in many cases thought it was easy.  If I had stayed along this path, I\u2019m pretty sure things would have not turned out as well as they did for me.  School is an incredibly artificial construct that rarely resembles the real world.  And if I kept up with that attitude, I was probably in for a rude awakening, or worse yet, be in denial about it.  Luckily some smart people (literally) helped me along the way.\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduate school was a formative time in this respect.  I was simultaneously studying for my Master\u2019s (and PhD later on) while working at a startup my advisor founded trying to commercialize his research.  The lucky break I had with this opportunity is that I met a couple of folks, one of my advisor\u2019s students and one at the startup, who set me straight.  But they didn\u2019t do it directly, in fact, I\u2019m pretty sure they didn\u2019t even know or mean to do it.  All they really did was be great colleagues and give me the opportunity to work alongside them, except for one very important detail: they were obviously smarter than me.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow smart can be defined in many ways, but however you define it, occasionally you meet someone who is just on a different level than you.  It\u2019s not that they just have more experience or work harder (sometimes it\u2019s both or neither), their brains just work faster than yours.  They\u2019re quicker, get to the conclusion faster, frame the problem in ways that you hadn\u2019t imagined, and all around are just clearly better than you at solving precisely the types of problems you think you\u2019re good at.  And for me, meeting not one but two of these fellows, gave me the great privilege of being greatly humbled.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere I was this hotshot who did so well in school, but felt completely dwarfed by these two folks.  I soon realized that I wasn\u2019t the smartest in the room, and I had to adjust accordingly.  And it was probably done in the best way possible where these two folks would actually mentor me and help me learn.  What better environment can there be than to have super smart nice people help you learn and grow?  This is one of the reasons why I look back so fondly on my graduate school days even though it was (at times) tortuous work being on the paper publishing treadmill while simultaneously working for a struggling startup.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince then I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with a few others who were on another level and it\u2019s been one of the great joys of my career.  And it\u2019s not only been on an intellectual level.  I met others who were just on some higher plane of thinking in other areas such as emotional intelligence, leadership or salesmanship.  It\u2019s been so rewarding learning from them, often times just by working alongside them.  Growing alongside smart folks who are nice enough to have me along for the ride has been one of the great privileges I\u2019ve had in my career.\n\n\n\n\n\nNowadays, I\u2019m a lot less cocky about most things (but I think others would agree that I\u2019m still not quite modest).  If I were to guess, some of it ironically stems from the confidence I\u2019ve gained in my abilities that has allowed me to eschew that unnecessary crutch.  However, I know at least a big part of it is due to all the amazingly smart folks that I\u2019ve met and worked with along the way.  Without the opportunity to work alongside them, learn from them, and grow with them, I would be in a very different place in my career.  If you haven\u2019t had a similar experience yet, I highly recommend it, because it\u2019s probably one of the most impactful things that can happen in your career.\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\n2017 Year-In-Review\n This is kind of an ironic statement in a post about humility but I quantitatively was a very good student.  I had the highest graduating grade point average in my high school and second in my region.  In my undergrad, I actually had the highest average in my graduating class and got an award to that effect.  Although for my undergrad it\u2019s a bit misleading because I believe someone in my program-year had a higher average than me but that year they had two computer engineering classes so technically I was first in my class but second in my year.

{"title": "2020 Year-In-Review", "content": "2020 Year-In-Review\n\t\t\n\nPhew, what a crazy year!  So many things have happened this year, and I\u2019m not talking just about the global pandemic.  It hasn\u2019t been easy but with some luck, lots of support from my loved ones, and a new shining star in my life, 2020 has been a surprisingly good year for me!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I had to put a theme to 2020, it would\u2019ve been change.  So many aspects of my life have changed that I\u2019m squarely in a \u201cnew chapter\u201d of my life.  I\u2019ll get into the details below but definitely lots of new priorities for me, new challenges, and \nmaking more time for what\u2019s important\n.  I think you\u2019ll be able to see the shift looking back at my previous reviews (\n2019\n, \n2018\n, \n2017\n).\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m really looking forward to 2021, mostly for the same reasons everyone else \u2014 a return to pre-pandemic normalcy.  Thus far, I haven\u2019t been able to really share my good fortune with my friends and family (at least in person), which I\u2019m just itching to do.  2021, you can\u2019t come fast enough!  Alright, let\u2019s get to it.\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily: \nThe biggest event to happen to me has been on the personal front: my daughter was born this past summer!  She\u2019s been the center of my life since she was born, and has now become my primary motivation for practically everything.  More money, more time, more knowledge?  It\u2019s all so I can give and teach her the best that I can provide. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis is obviously a big shift in mentality from before.  I was discussing this with a friend and he remarked: \u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit depressing that your life now just revolves around your baby?\u201d  In my pre-baby mindset, I probably would\u2019ve agreed.  Post-baby though, it\u2019s different.  It\u2019s almost feels like any motivations I had earlier were either selfish or hollow.  Not to be too dramatic about it, but my daughter has given me a new sense of meaning in my life.  It\u2019s a weird feeling but from what I gather, many other parents have had similar experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll spare everyone the details about sleep deprivation, overwhelming joys of being a father, and usual struggles of first time parents.  Instead, I\u2019ll just list a few tips that I\u2019ve found really useful so far (all of them advice I\u2019ve received from friends and family):\n\n\n\n\n\nWhenever someone offers you help, accept it!  It\u2019s no time for modesty or being polite.  Newborns are a tremendous amount of work, you need all the help you can get!  (Fortunately, I\u2019ve been so blessed to have a lot of support from my family, even with the pandemic looming over our heads.)\nKeep a \nwritten\n journal of your babies development (I just use the notes program on my phone to keep track of notable things every week).  My friend gave me this advice lamenting that he has terabytes of photos and video of his kids but couldn\u2019t remember when certain things happened (like their first words).  I\u2019ve documented the day when we were at the hospital (because I was worried I would forget), and began documenting important developments starting at around 4 weeks of age when I got this advice.  It\u2019s useful for posterity but even more useful to really cherish the moments.  When you\u2019re in a sleep deprived state, you usually aren\u2019t in the mindset to try to remember all the notable details \u2014 writing it down really helps.\nUse some system to automatically tag your photos.  It helps when you want to find something later on, and it allows you to put together \u201calbums\u201d from that time period.  It also allows you to put together those \u201ccheesy\u201d automatically generated slide show videos (something I\u2019ve discovered: it\u2019s only cheesy when it\u2019s not your kid).  Luckily, the iPhone system does most of this automatically.  It recognizes people, places, and time and will add the appropriate tag.  The only caveat is that my daughter\u2019s face is changing so fast that the iPhone can\u2019t recognize it after a few weeks so I have to just tag one of the newer photos periodically.  It\u2019s a small amount of manual effort for a reasonably indexed system of photos.  (Bonus: make sure to back it up too)\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a bunch of other baby related tips that I\u2019ve picked up too but I\u2019m not too confident that they are universally applicable, so I\u2019ll leave those to the experts.  I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have much more to add to this next year, and I\u2019m really looking forward to every moment!\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty Ownership\n: This year also marks the first time I actually own property!  Last year with the baby on the way, we were casually browsing what is on the market but didn\u2019t find anything in our price range that met our aesthetic.  Luckily in the middle of the pandemic we were able to swoop up a great place that had just come on the market with no competition in sight!  It is (and was) a pretty rare thing in Toronto except for a few month stretch in the middle of the pandemic, so we\u2019re counting our blessings.  Of course with property ownership comes huge debt in the form of a mortgage.  We got a great rate, again due to record low interest rates, so I\u2019m not complaining but it does feel like a heavier burden with a big mortgage looming over your head versus our carefree renter attitude of yesteryear.  \n\n\n\n\n\nIn any case, we\u2019re super thrilled with the house, especially with the baby and the need for more space.  Lots of small little projects and some big ticket items we need to spend on to get the house in good shape, but we\u2019re still very happy with the purchase and look forward to building many special memories here.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquisition\n: Speaking of big changes, the past six years of my life at \nRubikloud\n have culminated in an acquisition by \nKinaxis\n.  I posted a \nretrospective\n on the whole experience.  There was obviously a lot that I \ndidn\u2019t \nwrite about and a whole wealth of learnings that I will get to some day when it\u2019s not so raw.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one thing that I will mention is that it was a pretty stressful time!  The COVID lockdown had just started and I was involved in all the usual due diligence activities \nin addition\n to my regular duties, which probably amounted to roughly a 60 hour workweek \nplus\n it consuming my thoughts for the rest of my waking hours.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a lot of preparation, I probably ended up writing more than 50 pages of technical documents over a month or so (including the retrospective).  And after that, there were numerous presentations to explain the documents and walk them through all of the various activities.  I will say that it wasn\u2019t an unpleasant experience (and pretty good as far as DDs go as I hear, pandemic notwithstanding), just stressful because of the usual high stakes uncertainty of it all.  Luckily, things worked out pretty well and, as usual, my wife was incredibly supportive of me during this time of stress.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for life at Kinaxis, I\u2019m starting to settle in.  It\u2019s a slightly different industry (supply chain in general vs. retail/CPG), but I\u2019m glad that our team is still working on the same types of problems but at a bigger scale.  It\u2019s also nice to have the resources of a bigger company behind you to really tackle some of the ambitious things that we were never able to do as a smaller company.  I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have a lot more to write about next year when I\u2019ve had more time to work with the team and integrate with the company.\n\n\n\n\n\nRotman\n: Not much has changed at Rotman for me.  I\u2019m still teaching, and helping out with various functions at the Management and Data Analytics lab.  This year I was teaching a full half-year course on deep learning (with applications to marketing).  I really like my offering of the course, which is a departure from the typical CS treatment.  It\u2019s much more focused on the intuition rather than the theory (at least that\u2019s my approach).  Luckily due to scheduling, we jam packed the teaching within 5 weeks in January and February, right before the pandemic hit hard so I wasn\u2019t forced to move to online teaching.  I will be teaching online in 2021 though, which is going to be an interesting experience that I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll write more about next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nHobbies\n\n\n\n\n\nBooks\n: Pre-pandemic, I was reading a few books but with the confluence of the pandemic and the acquisition (and the associated stress), I wasn\u2019t able to read much.  The main \u201ctrick\u201d that I find with reading is that you have to find a consistent, ideally daily, time for it.  In other words, make it a habit.  I had a decent routine pre-pandemic of reading before bed.  I continued this for a bit during the beginning but eventually reverted to watching TV instead, which felt a bit more relaxing.  After the baby came along, my schedule got turned upside down and I\u2019m just beginning to find some time again to read.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key to finding time to read is making it a daily habit.  And to start a habit, you want to have an easy \u201cone foot hurdle\u201d to jump over until it becomes a habit.  In the case of reading (which I got the idea from this video about \nhow to read more\n), you want to set some super low bar such as reading one page per day.  That\u2019s it, just one.  Of course, it\u2019ll rarely be one, maybe three, maybe 10, but as long as you can keep it up every day, it\u2019ll start to stick.  \n\n\n\n\n\nWith that goal in mind, the next thing to do is to find a time during the day.  For me, it\u2019s usually during my morning routine (embarrassingly often on the toilet) that I make sure I get my \u201cone page\u201d in.  Previously, this time was filled with news and social media, which I\u2019m happy to spend less time on.  The other place I\u2019ve found that works is when I\u2019m holding the baby for a nap. It\u2019s almost the ideal situation, I\u2019m usually in a quiet room with only myself (and a sleeping baby) for almost an hour. The only problem is that it\u2019s usually dark and my arms are mostly occupied. The solution has been the Kindle app on my phone. I\u2019m not a huge fan of e-books but I\u2019ve got to make compromises somewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last thing to keep me on track are daily reminders.  I\u2019ll probably write a post on it later, but the \nDue App\n is amazing!  You can set reminder like you usually wont to, but the great thing about it is that it keeps bugging you with notifications until you either snooze or mark as done.  For example, I set a reminder daily at 8 am in the morning to read one page.  If I don\u2019t end up reading one page by 8:30am, I\u2019ll get a reminder.  If I didn\u2019t snooze it, come 9:30am, I\u2019ll have another few reminders.  Seeing that you have dozens of notifications (when I\u2019ve turned off most other notifications) really gets my attention.  It\u2019s really great at making sure I don\u2019t just ignore it and carry on with my day.  I used it for a couple of other things mentioned below as well to form habits (in addition to the usual purposes for one-off reminders).\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog\n: As you can see from my blogs, I didn\u2019t do much this year.  On the personal blog front, I only had a couple of posts on the \npandemic\n and \nacquisition\n.  On the technical front, I also only had two posts on \nSHAP\n and \nANS\n.  The last two I\u2019m most surprised with because technical posts are way more involved.  I\u2019m still trying to figure out how I can get time to do more writing. Writing is a bit harder than reading in that I can\u2019t just write one sentence at a time (or at least I think I can\u2019t), and I can\u2019t do it in a dark room while I\u2019m holding the baby.  The only time I seem to get to write now is when I have a vacation or break (like this post over the Christmas break).  I\u2019m hoping that as the baby gets older with a regular sleep pattern, I can go back to a routine I had before of waking up early and doing 30-60 mins of writing.  Right now, it\u2019s not quite feasible because I\u2019m struggling to get enough sleep as it is with the baby.  I guess you\u2019ll see how I do next year!\n\n\n\n\n\nChinese\n: 2020 hasn\u2019t been a great year for learning Chinese either (with one exception).  After lockdown, I stopped going to in-person Chinese lessons and had almost no time (or mind space) to learn Chinese.  The one exception was that I had been spending more time with my wife\u2019s family who are native speakers, so I did improve a bit on that front.  After the baby came, I tried to do virtual Chinese lessons in the evenings but that was unmanageable with the baby whose bed time was around the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy new strategy is two fold: the first strategy is that I bought some Chinese books on my Kindle app that I also throw into the reading mix, and in conjunction I\u2019m also using the \nPleco\n flashcard app to help remember new words.  The other strategy that I\u2019m planning is to start virtual Chinese classes (or tutoring) on the weekends where it\u2019s easier to schedule an hour.  Let\u2019s see how it goes.\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic\n: The theme continues where I haven\u2019t really done much music wise.  I haven\u2019t taken in-person lessons since the beginning of the year, and I\u2019m not too fond of doing them virtually because I\u2019m really annoyed by video lag.  One bright spot is that I\u2019m singing and playing guitar for my daughter.  That\u2019s a lot of fun (even though she pretty much likes all music, no matter how poorly played), and it really makes me a bit proud of the work I\u2019ve put in over the years to improve.  Hopefully I can go back to in-person lessons when this is all over.\n\n\n\n\n\nFitness\n: With all the stress above, fitness has been tough.  Luckily, post-pandemic my wife convinced me to do virtual training with my personal trainer.  That\u2019s worked out well because I almost never feel like exercising but having a scheduled time really gives me the \u201ckick in the butt\u201d I need to do some good for myself.  After the fact, I\u2019m almost always happy that I had worked out.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other thing that I\u2019ve been doing recently in the last month is walking.  The previous owner of my house had a treadmill that I bought, and I\u2019ve been aiming to do exactly 21 minutes of walking everyday on it while slowly ratcheting up the distance every time.  Let\u2019s me explain it a bit.  \n\n\n\n\n\nWhy 21 minutes?  Because that\u2019s pretty much exactly the time a regular sitcom episode takes (I have a TV setup in front of my treadmill).  The everyday part (or more realistically 4 out of 7 days a week) is about trying to keep a habit going.  The ideal time I found to do it is right after the baby goes to sleep where I have roughly an hour of personal time (30 mins walking, 30 min getting ready for bed) when my wife is watching the baby (my wife and I swap after my hour is done, and I reserve the baby watching time for additional TV).  \n\n\n\n\n\nMy real goal is not actually walking but running, and this is a \u201ctrick\u201d to get me into the habit.  Initially, I just walked at a slow pace for an episode of a sitcom (started re-watching Parks and Recreation), and the next day I just tried to beat my distance by 0.01 miles (treadmill uses the imperial system).  So far so good, I\u2019ve increased my distance in 21 minutes by roughly 0.15 miles.  At this point, I\u2019m starting to have to run near the end of the 21 minutes in order to beat the time, which is exactly what I want.  The best part is that it\u2019s not too much of a burden: I get to watch TV and each day is basically just as easy as the day before.  So far so good, let\u2019s see how it goes.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking to 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers have put it more eloquently but I can\u2019t wait until 2021 gets here.  2020 has been a crazy year (in almost all respects), and I\u2019m glad if 2021 is a bit more boring.  I could use a boring year to settle into things and adjust to my new life as a father and at a new company.  Most of all, I\u2019m looking forward to being able to meet with my friends and family, especially introducing them to my daughter in-person.  We\u2019re almost there so make sure you and your loved ones are staying happy and healthy, and have a happy new year!\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\n2022 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2020/12/2020-year-in-review/"}
{"title": "Rubikloud Retrospective", "content": "Rubikloud Retrospective\n\t\t\n\nNote to Reader: Rubikloud Technologies Inc. was acquired by Kinaxis Inc. in July 2020 for $60M USD.  I was part of the founding team being there (almost) from the beginning where I led all our AI efforts as the Chief Data Scientist.  This post is an adaption of a retrospective memo I sent out before the acquisition closed.\n\n\n\n\n\nSix years ago I decided to take a leap of faith and join a diverse group of intellectually curious individuals on their journey to building the future of enterprise AI.\u00a0 Of course none of us knew that at the time, we were just a bunch of wide eyed dreamers hoping for the best, desperately trying to find a product-market fit.\u00a0 It seems like a lifetime ago when I was sitting in that cold, poorly lit room surrounded by cheap Ikea desks, stained carpets, and a large refrigerator box-turned-cubicle at 95 King Street.\u00a0 The contrast to where we ended up could not be more stark: being acquired by one of the fastest growing supply chain management companies in the world for\n \nour\n technology, people and products.\n\u00a0 The combination of these three reasons is a testament to everything that we built here.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Rubikloud\u2019s success might look modest, underneath it hides a mountain of mistakes, miscalculations, and misfortune.\u00a0 Those who have not been through the entire lifecycle of a venture backed startup may not understand the seemingly insurmountable odds that a young company faces.\u00a0 The stars really aligned for us to get to this point.\u00a0 I can probably name at least a dozen things that, if it didn\u2019t go just right, we would have easily failed.\u00a0 If that one key hire didn\u2019t join, if that one key customer didn\u2019t take a leap of faith, or if that one key technology wasn\u2019t available, then we would have been dead in the water.\u00a0 There\u2019s a reason why most startups fail.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s so interesting to look back and see what made us successful.\u00a0 There will always be a component of luck in any venture but luck isn\u2019t just a (fair) coin flip.\u00a0 There are some key things that tilted the balance in our favor and gave us the best chance of \u201ctaking off\u201d.\u00a0 In this retrospective, I want to reflect upon the most important things that made us successful.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s probably the biggest cliche but people are really what made Rubikloud special.\u00a0 Coming to work and getting to work alongside bright, hard working and dedicated folks who are all working towards an audacious goal \u2014 against all odds \u2014 has been one of the highlights of my career.\u00a0 Regardless of anything else, one thing I can guarantee is that current \nand \nformer Rubikrew will all agree that the people are what made Rubikloud special.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interesting thing about working so closely on these, sometimes insurmountable, challenges is that you build a special kind of shared experience with your colleagues.\u00a0 This experience is more than just \u201cthat\u2019s some person I work with\u201d and extends to a \u201cbrother/sister in arms\u201d-like relationship.\u00a0 These experiences and connections that I\u2019ve built with so many of the Rubikrew I will treasure forever, many of which have already translated into lifelong friendships filled with admiration and respect.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning (and Failing)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other cliche about startups, if there ever was one, is the amount of learning that you can do.\u00a0 There were so many things from product market fit to technology to leadership that we were learning how to do on the fly (and regrettably, sometimes to the detriment of our people and customers).\u00a0 This is part and parcel of the startup game.\u00a0 The one constant that accompanies learning is \nfailing\n.\u00a0 Failing to predict where the market is going, failing to predict what architecture would suit us in the future, and failing to anticipate all of the thousands of other bumps along the way.\u00a0 The interesting part about failing though is that it leads to learning.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve made an order of magnitude more mistakes at Rubikloud than at any other job in my career, and by the same token, I\u2019ve grown many orders of magnitude more than anywhere else I could have gone.\u00a0 Startups are not for the faint of heart.\u00a0 But somehow at Rubikloud, we\u2019ve accumulated the right people, culture and ethos to keep persisting, surviving and enduring through the constant onslaught of unknowns while climbing towards that audacious goal.\u00a0 This is not normal.\u00a0 Most people don\u2019t react well to failure, most people don\u2019t have that drive to learn, and most people don\u2019t push themselves to become more than they were yesterday.\u00a0 Somehow at Rubikloud we\u2019ve managed to do that.\u00a0 And I know, at least for me and I hope for everyone else, that it has shaped you in some significant way that will pay dividends in whatever future jobs you have in your career.\n\n\n\n\n\nTiming and Compressed Timelines\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you might already expect, the last point I want to discuss is another cliche: timing.\u00a0 Timing is everything in a startup.\u00a0 Too early, and no customers are there; too late, and other players have already saturated the market.\u00a0 By some stroke of luck, we were at the right place at the right time with the convergence of cloud and ML technologies, retailers transitioning to those technologies, and a generous funding environment for startups.\u00a0 Of course, this just sets the stage for success but the above two points (people and learning) are equally important to run a successful show.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough timing is key, there is another strange phenomenon that happens in startups: time dilation.\u00a0 It\u2019s almost as if a lifetime\u2019s worth of experiences gets compressed into a tiny slice of time.\u00a0 In this tiny slice of time, you get to experience so many things that would take years to achieve: accelerated professional growth, meaningful lifelong friendships, and an emotional roller coaster of ups and downs.\u00a0 We\u2019re fortunate to have gone through this experience for this long along with a positive outcome; most startups fail and most outcomes are poor.\u00a0 To have gotten all the benefits of this startup time dilation phenomenon, and to continue to be able to build out the amazing technology that we have, I\u2019m counting my blessings that I got to participate in this awesome journey.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking To The Future\n\n\n\n\n\nThe acquisition by Kinaxis brings a new chapter for all of us at Rubikloud.\u00a0 We\u2019ll still be focusing on the same goal of \u201cIntelligent Decision Automation\u201d but with a new company, new context, and new customers.\u00a0 I\u2019m truly excited about fulfilling our mission of bringing AI to the enterprise and fulfilling the promise of AI.\u00a0 It\u2019s not every job where you can work on leading-edge tech that has a meaningful impact on a critical component of the global economy.\u00a0 The industry we\u2019re in may not be saving lives but it is definitely saving waste (a less often considered virtue but an important one nonetheless).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat made Rubikloud special is going to be different than what is going to make Kinaxis so special.\u00a0 The people will still be here, just with more of them (i.e. 800 vs. 80).\u00a0 The learning will be there, just with different problems (i.e. scaling up instead of product market fit).\u00a0 The timing is one thing that will feel very different though.\u00a0 Things might start to feel slower compared to Rubikloud (no startup time dilation effect) with more communication overhead and more processes, but that comes with some benefits too.\u00a0 There will be significantly fewer \u201cheroic overtime\u201d hours needed, more space to build out thoughtfully designed systems, and more time to focus on our respective areas instead of just trying to plug the latest hole in our leaky boat.\u00a0 Most importantly, it will allow us to have more time \noutside\n of work instead of being all-consumed by it.\n\n\n\n\n\nI truly believe that there is a bright future for all the Rubikrew at Kinaxis.\u00a0 While I\u2019m under no impression that everyone is going to stay here forever (just like no one expected to retire at Rubikloud), I do hope that everyone will find a place at Kinaxis where they feel they can grow their career alongside amazing people with work that they find meaningful.\u00a0 And while things may seem a bit uncertain now with many questions still to be answered, I would suggest slowing down and

{"title": "Lessons From A Pandemic", "content": "Lessons From A Pandemic\n\t\t\n\nAt this point in 2020, there\u2019s a global pandemic.  It\u2019s a surreal experience because everyone is going through the same restrictions but all in such a personal way.  It\u2019s only been around a couple of months under lock down but for me it\u2019s already been quite a journey.  I wanted to write down my thoughts and experiences so I wouldn\u2019t forget some of the lessons that I\u2019ve been learning along the way (that\u2019s what most of this site is about after all).  It\u2019s not really anything novel, it\u2019s probably the most standard advice you could get but there is something to be said about \nmastering the fundamentals\n.  At the same time, things seem to be moving so quickly that I wanted a record of what I was thinking and experiencing.  I hope it helps you in some way.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusting\n\n\n\n\n\nIt took a bit of time for me to adjust.  In fact, it actually took a bit of time for me to figure out that I had to adjust!  In the first 3-4 weeks of the pandemic, I felt a bit lost.  My motivation at work was low, I wandered from Zoom meeting to Zoom meeting, and I was struggling to figure out how to be productive while cooped up in my home.  Energy was at a low point, physically my body felt weak, and I had some anxiety, not about the pandemic, but about how I was feeling.  If you\u2019re reading this at another period in time it might sound a bit dire, but in retrospect I think it was perfectly normal.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I\u2019ve observed is that whenever I enter a vastly different situation or setting, whether on vacation, moving, or some other significant change in my life, it takes time to adjust.  Seems obvious but only when you can remove yourself from the situation.  When you\u2019re in the situation, it\u2019s so hard to see it because it\u2019s clouded by your mental state at that point in time.  Now that I\u2019m pass the hump, it\u2019s obvious to me that I was in a rut.\n\n\n\n\n\nI actually think 3-4 weeks is a pretty good recovery period given that this is a once in a lifetime situation.  I\u2019ll chalk it up to the amazing people I have around me, especially my wife, who have supported me during this time.  If you\u2019re taking longer to adapt \u2014 it\u2019s okay!  Try to find what works for you to get back to a new normal and hopefully we\u2019ll all be out of this soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoutines\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the key things that seem to correlate with my rut is losing my routine.  For the first month or so, I would literally roll out of bed in my PJs and start jumping on Zoom for my first meeting.  I\u2019m a bit ashamed to admit, I even forgot to brush my teeth on a few occasions.  That\u2019s just an example of my lack of routine.  Others include: not showering every day, not shaving regularly, inconsistent sleep/wake times, poor diet, not cutting my hair, inconsistent work times, and the list goes on.  It takes time to establish a productive routine, and if there\u2019s one thing to throw it off, it\u2019s a global pandemic!\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a bit obvious but get a routine going!  Wake up every morning around the same time, go through your morning routine (showering, brushing teeth, grooming, changing into work clothes etc.), have lunch around the same time, start and end work around the same time.  These are all very basic recommendations, which I\u2019m sure everyone has heard but probably didn\u2019t follow when this whole thing started!  These \nhidden things\n shape our mental state more than we think, and we tend to underestimate their effect.  So get a productive routine going!\n\n\n\n\n\nSleep\n\n\n\n\n\nSleep\n is important, I think almost everyone can agree with that.  Getting good sleep is another story though.  When stress is high, anxiety is high, physical activity is low, and inconsistent bed times are abound, getting good sleep is hard.  Truthfully, I haven\u2019t fully figured this out yet.  There are times when I have trouble sleeping due to stress from work, which often correlates with me working through the evening.  However, other things like consistent bed times, physical activity and low caffeine have helped.  After some reflection, stress at work is probably the main cause of my intermittent poor night\u2019s sleep.  If you\u2019re having issues with getting good sleep, I would suggest you to experiment with a few different things.  Not all of them will work but I\u2019m sure some combination of them will.\n\n\n\n\n\nLimiting News\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with many others, I was constantly checking the news for new information about this novel coronovirus: watching hours of news clips, browsing every article on Apple News, and checking the growth in numbers several times a day.  This is not a healthy way to go about things.  The best analogy I can come up with is the stock market.  It\u2019s a terrible idea to look at stock prices daily.  It\u2019ll just give you anxiety, and the truth is that there is very little that you absolutely need to know on a minute by minute basis (or hour to hour for that matter).  \n\n\n\n\n\nSo the caveat was that at the beginning of the pandemic, there were a lot of policy changes that were coming our rapidly, so you could argue frequent checking was justified.  But as the days went on, the incremental information that was derived from news dropped dramatically.  At this point in time, reading the news once or twice a week is probably sufficient.\n\n\n\n\n\nI haven\u2019t fully got myself off of the news cycle.  I check the numbers once daily after work, and I still browse my regular news feeds when on a break, which are dominated by COVID-19 news.  However, I\u2019m much more selective on which articles I select since most headlines are sensationalized, politicized or have no consequential information for me.  My recommendation is to consciously cut back on news.  It\u2019s one of those things that give you a short burst of dopamine akin to social media, but in the long term has a negative effect for your psyche.\n\n\n\n\n\nWork Setup\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the obvious things (but took me a while) was getting my work setup productive.  I have an office at home where I usually do my work.  It\u2019s a nice setup with a 27\u2033 monitor, and an ergonomic keyboard, mouse and chair.  It was working well at first but my wife also started working from home and kicked me out (she has more calls than me usually).  At that point I was relegated to the kitchen table where I had none of those things.  \n\n\n\n\n\nIt took me a week or two of working there with an uncomfortable setup to realize that I should convert it into something more manageable.  I pulled out an extra monitor (with a stack of books to raise the height), brought over my ergonomic mouse, keyboard and chair, and also got a box as a foot rest because the height of the table was much higher than my desk.  The setup works pretty well but one of the biggest realizations was that I shouldn\u2019t be in the same position all the time (even with an ergonomic chair).  This means taking breaks, switching to a bench seat (for variety) or standing up (with wireless headphones).  It\u2019s working well enough that I don\u2019t have any obvious pain from the setup.\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n\nA few weeks after the start of the pandemic, I started getting incredibly tight muscles (to the point that they would randomly ache).  It was obvious that it was due to the work from home situation but I couldn\u2019t quite isolate why.  I fixed my work setup, which helped a bit.  I also started doing some yoga a few times a week, that also helped a bit.  But the big factor I think was the sudden drop in physical activity.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the pandemic, I was working out at least once a week with my personal trainer and had some light physical activity commuting to and from work.  After the pandemic, all of this basically stopped with almost no physical activity.  It turns out no physical activity combined with the majority of your time in a single position is bad for your body, who knew?  My wife finally convinced me that we should do Zoom training and it\u2019s been great!  I\u2019ve upped the sessions to roughly twice a week with a more HIT-style workout (since we don\u2019t have many weights).  Most of the pain is gone (so long as I keep moving).  I think one of the key factors for me was the increase in heart rate (and the associated muscle activation I guess).  That\u2019s one of the reasons why I think Yoga alone wasn\u2019t working (admittedly it was only beginner Yoga).  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe moral of the story is exercise!  It also has other added benefits like increased energy for a couple of days after and better sleep.  Sometimes just getting the \nbasics\n right is all you need.\n\n\n\n\n\nWalking\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides the physical issues with being sedentary, it also has a mental component.  Being in the same physical space 24/7 for weeks on end is not healthy.  We can\u2019t congregate in close physical spaces but we can very easily physical distance when outside.  Something that I would highly recommend is more walking (or running if you can).  Being able to physically change locations is healthy.  It\u2019s definitely had a calming effect on me, especially in the beginning days when anxiety was high.\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Contact\n\n\n\n\n\nWe may take it for granted but having contact with other humans is important!  Again part of this mental health that we often take for granted when things are going smoothly.  I live with my wife so the stress on me is less but I still find it very helpful to chat with my family, play games with my friends, and even spend a bit of time doing \u201cwater cooler\u201d talk with co-workers.  I wouldn\u2019t discount the value in adding back some of the human contact where you can (virtually).  If you can do a physically-distanced in-person meetings that also works well.  I\u2019ve visited my family with masks and a good few metres of distance several times and it feels really good.\n\n\n\n\n\nFind Time to Unwind\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, maybe an obvious thing but find some time to relax!  Whatever that means to you, whether that\u2019s binging TV or playing some online games with friends.  Of course, you can\u2019t go to the movie theater or out for dinner but that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t other things you can do to relax.  I\u2019ve mostly used TV and computer games, although I do very much miss going to a nice restaurant to eat.  If those aren\u2019t satisfying enough, keep searching!  It\u2019s important to find an activity where you can unplug from work and the whole situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nWork Productivity: Write it Down!\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the obvious downsides when working from home is that communication is much harder.  Where we could easily turn our chair to the next seat to ask a question, we now have to Slack them, wait for a response, and be blocked more often than before.  However, the bigger issue that I\u2019m finding is that it\u2019s so much harder to make sure I\u2019m on the same page with others.  I think there are two main issues.  The first is that we no longer have a high-bandwidth communication method (in-person meeting with a white board).  This is definitely a big drawback.  The latency over video chat slows the conversation and inhibits real-time feedback, and the lack of a whiteboard really hurts our ability to express ourselves in an easy way.  I\u2019ve found alternate ways to do this like a shared doc with annotations but it\u2019s no panacea.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe other big issue (related to the first one) is that it\u2019s much harder to be aligned with others.  Whereas we had multiple ways to be in sync with others before (in-person, whiteboard, shared doc, etc.).  Now we\u2019re limited to virtual tools only.  I find the natural inclination is to be much more reliant on verbal communication in roughly the same proportion as in-person.  However as mentioned above, it\u2019s much lower bandwidth.  That means, it takes much longer to get to the same point of alignment compared to in-person.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy big realization (again pretty obvious for those who have done this for a while) is to use more efficient methods of synchronization and rely less on verbal communication.  That is, do more asynchronous writing!  One of the great things about writing is that is focuses your thinking.  Whereas it\u2019s easy to have verbal diarrhea when speaking in real-time, it\u2019s much harder to do that in writing because you get to look back at what you wrote.  It\u2019s also much easier to be precise when writing, where precision is not easy, nor natural with verbal communication.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been doing much more writing since working from home and I\u2019ve been encouraging others to do more of it.  In fact, it probably would\u2019ve been a good thing if we were doing more of it before the pandemic as well.  Anecdotally, it\u2019s having a good response in that more people are disagreeing  with me right away.  Before, we could discuss a topic for 30 minutes and everyone would feel like they were aligned (when in fact they were not).  We would go off and do work only to find out much later that there was a misunderstanding.  Contrast that with having written down the details before the 30 minute sync where others can see precisely where they disagree with you.  It\u2019s much more productive to catch these things earlier in the process.\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting may not come natural to many people though.  My best advice: practice, practice, practice!  You\u2019ll get better at it, it\u2019ll come more naturally, and it\u2019s a key skill for your career, so why wouldn\u2019t you do more of it?  If you have a similar experience to me, then you might even start to like it as well.  So start writing!\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no universal solution to what\u2019s happening right now.  We\u2019re all experiencing it in our own way and we have to find out what will work for each us in our own situation.  I\u2019m writing this down in hopes of sharing some of the things that worked for me but also for posterity to record what I was thinking and experience during this truly unprecedented event.  Stay healthy and safe!\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2020 Year-In-Review\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2020/05/lessons-from-a-pandemic/"}
{"title": "2019 Year-In-Review", "content": "2019 Year-In-Review\n\t\t\n\nAnother year, another review!  This is the third year (past reviews: \n2018\n, \n2017\n) that I\u2019ve done this review and I think it\u2019s an extremely useful exercise.  The past year has gone by in a flash (although at times, it didn\u2019t seem that way) and it\u2019s always a good idea to take stock of things and reflect on the year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I had to give a theme for the year it would be \nperspective\n.  While there have been many ups and downs this year, I\u2019m starting to be able to \u201csee the forest for the trees\u201d.  This is particularly true for my work at Rubikloud.  Things that I would\u2019ve in the past seen as \u201ccrises\u201d are just another one of the regular challenges of a fast growing startup.  Perhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019m clearly in my mid-30s or the fact that I\u2019ve seen my fair share of \u201ccrises\u201d at this point, but most problems aren\u2019t as big as they initially seem in the moment.  This is perhaps one of the most important realizations I\u2019ve had this year that has been extremely beneficial to my sanity and lower stress levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this new found perspective, I\u2019m really optimistic about next year.  There are so many great opportunities on the horizon, and I\u2019m so grateful for all the amazing people \u2014 across all the areas of my life \u2014 that I get to work with.  Here\u2019s to 2020 with hopes of becoming a little bit wiser and a little less ignorant!\n\n\n\n\n\nReflections\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of doing an \u201cAccomplishments\u201d section, I decided to just reflect on my major areas of focus for 2019 \u2014 good and bad.  I\u2019ll still include the \u201cFailures\u201d section below to call out specific issues that deserve special attention or that don\u2019t quite fit here.\n\n\n\n\n\nRubikloud\n\n\n\n\n\nColleagues: \nAs with most years at a fast growing startup, Rubikloud has been quite the rollercoaster ride in 2019.  It\u2019s been one of our best years to date but it\u2019s also been a bit of an emotional one too.  Several long-time team members with whom I was very close with have left the business.  It was definitely the right decision given their circumstances and career trajectory but it\u2019s always hard to see close friends or colleagues leave.  This is probably one of the most important lessons: business\u2019 needs change, people\u2019s needs change, and people enter and exit a business \u2014 I shouldn\u2019t take it personally, this is the normal course of things.  Obviously, just because someone isn\u2019t working with you anymore doesn\u2019t mean they are gone forever (you can and should keep in touch) but practically, it means you will see less of them.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe obvious flip side to this is that new people enter the business too!  And I\u2019m actually quite excited to work with many of the new team members who have joined recently.  They bring fresh new perspectives and ideas which I\u2019m excited to learn about.  And, of course, it also brings a chance to deepen my working relationships with many of the existing team members who are also given new opportunities to shine.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding Data Science Teams: \nOn a separate organizational note, I think we\u2019re really starting to hit our groove in building a good cross-functional data science practice.  In last year\u2019s review, I mentioned that I had some ideas about how to improve the data science work with cross-functional teams.  It turns out most of these ideas didn\u2019t quite work out exactly as planned.  I think I correctly identified many of the challenges (such as cross-functional teams require a lot of work and specifying requirements for data science projects) but found out several other ones that I didn\u2019t expect.  Two big ideas that we\u2019ve implemented:\n\n\n\n\n\nData science lead role\n: This is essential especially for cross functional projects.  The lead\u2019s main purpose is to align the project goals with the data science work.  A larger portion of their time is spent doing non-technical work such as meeting with other stakeholders and translating that into work that individual contributors can do.  I don\u2019t think this is specifically a data science problem, but a problem with any function that is deeply technical.  Others who are not specialists in the field will not be able to understand the technical subject matter and, more importantly, translate the overall project requirements into technical work.  The opposite problem also happens too: a technical specialist builds something that doesn\u2019t solve the underlying problem because they don\u2019t get the right feedback.  Sometimes you may get a \u201cunicorn\u201d data scientist who can do all of this but it\u2019s more rare than you would think.\nData science research meetings: \nThis second idea that is extremely important is to make sure your data scientists have an avenue to discuss and review their technical work.  This is harder than it sounds.  Code reviews that are common in software don\u2019t accomplish the same thing.  It requires deep discussion, often including white boarding to clarify the often abstract ideas of the solution.  My best attempt at this is to mimic the research meetings that you find in graduate school: a senior researcher holds the meeting where team members are given time to present their results to date.  The senior researcher\u2019s job is not to tell the other members what to do but to facilitate the meeting by asking probing questions, clarifying the explanation of other team members, and occasionally suggesting new ideas.  The big benefit besides helping the particular project along is that it also serves as a place for other team members to learn.  Finding ways to grow the research ability of our team has also been something on my mind lately, and this is definitely a good passive way to do it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWork-life Balance\n: And on a final note, I want to talk about work-life balance.  I was able to maintain some decent balance throughout most of the year \nexcept\n for a period in the fall.  During that time I was working evenings and weekends for about a month or so in order to try to get a project delivered.  This was a pretty stressful time for me causing me to approach burning out.  There were also a few knock-on effects on other parts of the company that I won\u2019t get into.  Luckily, I had pretty good support from my manager, the people team and my  wife.  We also have an unlimited vacation policy at Rubikloud, which has helped me decompress after the fact.\n\n\n\n\n\nI will say that burnout is a pretty real phenomenon, and when you\u2019re in a fast growing startup for five years, you\u2019re going to brush up against it at one point or another.  Reflecting back on my time at Rubikloud so far, I think many (but not all) of the times where I was pushing myself to meet a deadline were, in fact, necessary (given the situation).  That is, I think we would have a dramatically worse outcome if we had not pushed through.  Many will say that it if you planned properly then that would not have happened \u2014 I whole heartedly agree!  But hindsight is 20/20.  If I had my current experience, I probably could avoided some (but not all) of these cases.  I suspect part of the reason why burnout is so common at startups is because of inexperience planning for the unknown situations that lay ahead (the other big reason is that you have terrible managers who just want to exploit their employees).  I\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes in my career but I\u2019m learning from each one of them so I hope that there will be fewer and fewer of these situations.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the important point about these types of situations is that they need to be managed carefully.  You can\u2019t do it all the time and you need to give the affected team members time to recover.  With a bit more experience under my belt, I\u2019m a bit more aware of when I myself am starting to get burnt out.  I\u2019m also much more careful with my team to ensure that they don\u2019t get put into that situation.  Sometimes it\u2019s easy to forget that we\u2019re all just humans.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjunct Professor at Rotman School of Management\n\n\n\n\n\nThis past (calendar) year at Rotman my main accomplishments were around teaching, helping organize a couple small events and providing advice and guidance to a bunch of people.  One thing that I\u2019ve forgotten is how much fun teaching can be.  The position I have of teaching AI at a business school (but to analytics professionals) is quite unique.  Business school is much more focused on practical applications of things and less on theory.  I really enjoyed trying to distill some of the fundamental concepts in deep learning down to their most intuitive points and eschewing most of the cruft that is usually taught in those types of courses (similar to my technical blog).  Since it was a bit of a greenfield course, I was able to design it how I saw fit.  In the coming year, I\u2019ll be teaching a longer AI course with applications in marketing.  I very much enjoy putting together the material and teaching but I must say that it\u2019s a lot of work!  Distilling complex ideas into its core components and then putting together informative material is hard!  I\u2019m enjoying my time at Rotman and a couple of potential opportunities are opening up for me to potentially teach in the other professional programs.  It\u2019s definitely an exciting opportunity with the only downside being that it does put a lot of additional strain on my free time.  No rest for the wicked I guess.\n\n\n\n\n\nHobbies (Reading, Music and Learning Chinese)\n\n\n\n\n\nReading:\n On the reading front, I\u2019ve definitely got into a good habit of reading a few books each quarter and blogging about them (\nQ1\n, \nQ2\n, \nQ3\n, \nQ4\n).  I\u2019ve finally got over my bad habit of reading everything the same way, and instead just (a) read what interests me at that point in time, and (b) read it in the way that I feel like reading it.  When I write it out like that it seems obvious but for me it wasn\u2019t so easy.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe first point is really about putting books down that I\u2019m not in the mood for (a couple of which I mention in the blog posts above).  Sometimes I feel \u201cobligated\u201d to read a book because it\u2019s an important subject or because I bought it already.  That\u2019s a pretty big fallacy.  You won\u2019t get much out of a book that you are \u201cforcing\u201d yourself to read.  You should especially follow this rule if you\u2019re part-way through a book.  My important takeaway was that I should stop as soon as possible so I don\u2019t \u201close momentum\u201d reading, getting to that point where it becomes a chore.  Reading is really about getting what you want to get out of the book.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn that note, the second point is really about reading it in a way that allows you to get what you want out of the book.  For me that means two things (i) marking up the book with a pencil or pen to highlight and take notes on things that I want to remember and (ii) to skim or skip over parts that I don\u2019t find interesting or necessary.  Ever since elementary school, I\u2019ve had an aversion to marking up books because the teacher said not to, but in fact it\u2019s probably one of the most important things you can do to retain knowledge!  The other bad idea I had was that all the words in the book are created equal \u2014 they\u2019re not!  I now freely skim over paragraphs, or even whole chapters which I don\u2019t think are very important.  It\u2019s really helped me \u201ckeep momentum\u201d and my interest up in the books that I\u2019m reading.  It also allows me to focus in and read more carefully the parts that I\u2019m actually interested in.  Sounds simple but it took me a while to get here and I\u2019m loving it!\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic\n: I\u2019ve been doing a pretty good job of having regular lessons with my guitar/vocal teacher (every other week or so) but I haven\u2019t been doing a great job of diligently practicing between lessons.  My progress has been slower than ideal but I think that\u2019s okay since there are a bunch of other higher priority things that I\u2019ve been focusing on.  The aspect that I am the most proud of now is that, through my music lessons, I\u2019ve really started appreciating music much more (because I understand a lot more of the fundamentals) and it\u2019s become a regular part of my life.  I regularly pick up the guitar to sing and play for fun and enjoyment.  It really feels like my life is somehow richer because of it and isn\u2019t that the best measure of a good hobby?\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Chinese\n: Learning fluent Chinese has been one of my on-and-off long term goals for a while now.  This year (especially in the last quarter), I\u2019ve skipped a lot of Chinese classes.  My excuse (as always) is that there were higher priority things going on, which is true to some extent.  However, I\u2019ve made some incremental progress.  I\u2019m a bit more comfortable speaking now, a combination of being a bit more confident and having a slightly larger vocabulary.  One realization that I came to is that I was doing too much indirect practice for my ultimate goal: conversing in Chinese.  Examples of indirect practice were primarily around reading and writing.  Next year, I\u2019m going to try to get more practice speaking to family members, but also potentially experimenting with native speakers online to get some more convenient directed practice.  Hopefully in next year\u2019s update I can tell you all about the success I\u2019ve had using this method.\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth and Fitness\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been keeping up with weekly sessions with my personal trainer.  Strength wise, I\u2019m progressing at a slow pace but I\u2019m fine with it.  I\u2019m at around 5 pull-ups which is a personal best.  However, I\u2019ve really dropped off in the back half of the year for my goal of going to the gym at least twice a week (including my training session).  My excuse again here has been how busy I\u2019ve been with my other jobs.  However, in this case, it\u2019s a pretty poor excuse because my health is way more important than any job that I have.  The other side effect that I\u2019ve been experiencing is dramatic tightness of my muscles.  I\u2019ve gathered that this is a combination of (a) working my muscles hard with my trainer, (b) ignoring rolling out or stretching before/after workout sessions and during the week, and (c) little or no dynamic physical activity during the week.  This is really new territory for me where in the last five years or so, I\u2019m the least active I\u2019ve ever been.  Of course, I\u2019m trying to change that but making new habits takes time.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve started to try to do at least a bit of stretching, rolling out or yoga every day.  This is really to prevent the extremely unpleasant feeling of tight muscles.  The other thing that I\u2019m trying to do is engage my core all the time.  My realization is that a lot of lower back pain is caused by a weak core.  So it\u2019s not so much as having good posture, but rather engaging your core so you don\u2019t hurt your back.  The side effect is good posture.  At first, your core gets tired easily but the more you do it, the easier it should get.  So far so good.\n\n\n\n\n\nFailures\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section is going to be reserved for specific failures that I hope to learn from.  It\u2019s a natural tendency to hide your own failures but if you do you\u2019re missing a great opportunity to learn from them.  Worse yet, you may keep making the same mistake!  Hopefully this section will help me with the ignorance removal process.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal Setting: \nThis year I \nattempted\n to actually do a bit of goal setting for my personal goals (such as learning, health, and social relationships), using the OKR (objectives and key results) framework.  It\u2019s something we\u2019ve been doing at the company since last year and I think it\u2019s a very reasonable goal setting tool.  For a couple of quarters, I was actually doing okay with it.  However, when things got really busy in the fall, it basically dropped off the map and I stopped using it all together.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy big takeaway from it is that you really need to get into the \nhabit\n of using it (like most things).  It\u2019s a useful tool, as long as you\u2019re using it right.  When I was using it, I checked it every week to update it, which was a good frequency.  It didn\u2019t magically make me do things that I wouldn\u2019t have done otherwise, but rather reminded me to do things that I often forget about (like hanging out with friends) when things get busy.  The other nice thing about it is that the act of creating goals makes you think hard about your priorities, which is always a useful thing.  I might experiment with it again in the new year if things don\u2019t get too crazy.\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth, Stress and Sleep:\n This is one area where I would rate myself poorly this year.  Thankfully, I didn\u2019t have any major problems or injuries this year but I definitely did a poor job staying healthy (at least for the back half of the year).  As mentioned above, I haven\u2019t been keeping up with my non-trainer workout sessions, and combined with the stress from the busy times at work, it has definitely put my body in worse shape.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest fail in my mind though is really around sleep.  At times, I\u2019ve been having trouble sleeping through the entire night.  I can usually fall asleep very fast but wake up after 4 or 5 hours in the middle of the night and have trouble going back to sleep.  I\u2019ve been experimenting with a lot of hypotheses as to why I\u2019m waking up.  They\u2019re the usual things make the list: work, sedentary lifestyle, screens and caffeine.  It\u2019s clear that the main cause is work, however, it\u2019s usually not just stress from crises (although at times that happens), it\u2019s more the fact that I\u2019m thinking about issues all the time (as you do when you\u2019re at a startup).  This is definitely one of the reasons why I find it hard to go back to sleep at night: my mind is still thinking through and trying to solve problems at 4 am.  Part of the problem is that I actually enjoy thinking about these problems!  Obviously, I do not enjoy getting very little sleep and feeling tired the next day though.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe thing that I did notice was that this sleep issue was a relatively new phenomenon in the past year or so, and I think it\u2019s directly related to my lower fitness levels (and perhaps my age).  So I\u2019ve been telling myself to try to exercise more, which has been pretty unsuccessful.  It\u2019s a bit of a negative feedback loop because the most stressed you are, the more you want to relax on the couch, not run 5 km, but counter-intuitively, that\u2019s the opposite of what you should be doing!  Additionally, I\u2019ve been cutting back my caffeine intake a bit, which I think is probably a bit of a secondary benefit.  The mind and body are very much connected, and I\u2019m pretty convinced that more exercise will really make a big difference to solving this sleep issue (I almost never have trouble sleeping through the night after a session with my trainer).  I just have to find ways to make it stick.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping in good health is very much about experimenting with techniques that \nwork\n for you in the sense that you can get into the habit of doing it (most common techniques work pretty well if you can keep it up).  The hard part is that often once you have something that sort of works, life throws a few wrenches your way like a new job, an injury, or just plain getting old.  You just got to keep trying to find ways to stay healthy and stick to it.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlogging\n: I\u2019ve done a pretty poor job at blogging this year.  On the personal side, I\u2019ve been mainly writing about books I\u2019ve read, which keeps this site up to date with at least quarterly posts.  I\u2019ve been satisfied with this frequency; I have less to write about nowadays on my personal blog.  However, on my \ntechnical blog\n, I only put up 3 posts this past year.  This is well below my goal of 2-3 a quarter (quite ambitious actually).  I actually really enjoy learning and writing about things on my technical blog but my free time has mainly been filled up with an increased load at Rubikloud combined with preparation for teaching the AI marketing course at Rotman.  The latter actually is in a similar vein to my technical blog: learning about AI and putting together material (slides instead of a post).  However, the material isn\u2019t state of the art techniques, but more common-place fundamentals.  In retrospect, I\u2019m not too disappointed with my lack of work on the technical blog, my prioritization of things this year has been about right.  However, I do want to call it out because I sure don\u2019t want to make it a habit of brushing it off.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coming Year\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking forward to 2020, I\u2019m quite optimistic.  There are several exciting things going on in my personal life, my professional work at Rubikloud and Rotman look very promising, and my friends, my family and myself are in (relatively) good health.  It\u2019s hard to ask for more than this.  I hope you have an amazing 2020 filled with laughing, learning, and good fortune!\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2017 Year-In-Review\n2020 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2020/01/2019-year-in-review/"}
{"title": "Book Impressions \u2014 2019-Q4", "content": "Book Impressions \u2014 2019-Q4\n\t\t\n\nTuesdays with Morrie\n by Mitch Albom\n\n\n\n\n\nA re-read of this classic book that my friend gave me a while ago.  I was looking for something lighter to read on my bookshelf (which is made up of a mix of many non-fiction books that I have \nand\n haven\u2019t read but very few fictions books), and I came across this one.  It\u2019s a short, light and easy read, kind of nice from the heavier biography (the one below) that I was reading at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a story about a young man in college with a very special professor, Morrie, who teaches him about life.  After college, he drifts apart from that professor and goes on to face the world and all its challenges.  Many years later, by happenstance, he reunites with his old professor, who is dying, to take the most important \u201cclass\u201d of his life.  Through their Tuesday meetings, they talk about the human experience: family, money, love, marriage, forgiveness and, of course, death.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a nice little read to remind us of the \nimportant things in life\n and to not get too focused on the things that aren\u2019t so important like material success.  At first, I was a bit turned off because the book was slightly preachy and also a bit too simple (or maybe too direct?) in the way that Morrie explains these concepts.  That is until I realized that it\u2019s actually a \ntrue story\n!  I just assumed that this was fiction but the events in the book actually took place between Morrie and the author.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if you\u2019re not explicitly into reading about these topics I\u2019d recommend this book.  It\u2019s always good to have a reminder to cherish the important things around you, and this one is a cute little book that serves this purpose.  It\u2019s an easy read and serves as a nice break between heavier stuff.\n\n\n\n\n\nModels of My Life\n by Herbert A. Simon \n\n\n\n\n\nThis was another re-read of an autobiography I picked up a while back about a polymath named Herbert A. Simon.  He was simultaneously a Nobel Prize winner, Turing Award winner (the equivalent to Nobel Prize in computer science) and one of my personal intellectual heroes.  My technical blog is named after one of his big contributions to economic thought (\u201cBounded Rationality\u201d), and I found that I could relate to so many of the things that he went through in life from academic research and teaching to bigger topics like career choices and even love interests.  Here are some random thoughts about the book.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing in the AI field, it was illuminating hearing about the story from the beginning.  Simon was one of the original participants at the \u201cDartmouth Workshop\u201d, which is usually attributed as the first AI conference.  Hearing about all the different characters (and opinions) about how to approach AI was fascinating.  So many \u201cold\u201d techniques were being discovered at the time such as early search algorithms and linear programming.  Interestingly, Simon was a big advocate of trying to understand models of how the human mind works, and I believe he would likely be a big critic of how modern day deep learning eschews (or at least ignores) this original goal of AI.\nSimon was really a polymath.  His original field of study was political science, however, he quickly moved into higher level maths to, at first, study economics, then computer science and AI.  He, of course, learned to program early on and contributed to some of the early advances in AI.  On top of that, he was a polyglot (which included basic Chinese) and frequently read famous texts in their original languages.\nSimon himself was very much an empirical scientist.  He describes himself as an economist or sociologist by training but more like an engineer in spirit \u2014 a man after my own heart.  His keen focus on always the empirical (particularly in the face of messiness) is inspiring, especially at a time when economics (and other disciplines) was moving into more seductive theoretical areas.  Finding a model that actually matches reality was always more important to him than finding a (mathematically) beautiful one.\nOn teaching:\n\u201cI learned that there is no use lecturing to a class unless the class is listening. And they will only listen if you are saying something that they think they can understand and that seems relevant. They will listen better if you talk LOUDLY. If you pace up and down, you can tell from their moving heads whether they are following you (like the crowd at a tennis match).\u201d\n\u201cTeaching is not entertainment, but it is unlikely to be successful unless it is entertaining (the more respectable word would be \ninteresting\n).\u201d\n\u201cCoverage of subject matter is a snare and a delusion. You begin where the students are prepared to begin; and you carry them as far as you can without losing them. Whether that takes you to the end of the specified curriculum, half as far, or twice as far, is irrelevant.\u201d\n\u201cYou start every class by giving students the opportunity (or better, the obligation) to ask questions about their reading, about previous sessions, or about anything.\u201d\n\u201cStudents don\u2019t learn by being lectured at, anyways; they learn by thinking hard, solving problems, dissecting proofs\u2026 Enlightenments, like accidents, happen only to prepared minds. If students have thought about something, you can discuss it profitably in class; without the preparation, it is just a bull session.\u201d\nOn research:\n\u201cThere has been failure after failure of interdisciplinary \u2018teams\u2019 to integrate anything\u2026 except to the extent that individual team members became interdisciplinary. I would not give a dollar to assist a typical political scientist to collaborate with a typical economist unless each one of them gave me a sworn statement that he would study seriously and not in a dilettante\u2019s way the discipline of the other for at least a year.\u201d\nOn research: \u201cPush across the front; when you find a soft spot, wherever it may be, pour your reserves through and keep going. Research, groping through the uncertain and then unforeseeable, must be flexible to grasp and exploit every sign of progress.\u201d\n\u201cDoability and significance are always good bases for choosing research problems. We want a problem whose answer has interest and value, but only if we have some ideas for approaching it.\u201d\n\u201cI soon learned that one wins awards mainly for winning awards\u2026 Once one becomes sufficiently well known, one\u2019s name surfaces automatically as soon as an award committee assembles.\u201d\n\u201cThe true line is not between \u201chard\u201d natural science and \u201csoft\u201d social sciences, but between precise science limited to highly abstract and simple phenomena in the laboratory and inexact science and technology dealing with complex problems in the real world.\u201d\nOne of the recurring themes in the book was the metaphor of a maze.  He often viewed his life as a series of decision points in a maze that \u201cled\u201d him to where he ended up.  He\u2019s careful not to conflate his ingenuity or talent as the reason why he made the correct \u201cturn\u201d, rather more of an observation that success (or failure) is usually more of a matter of circumstance (the maze) combined with a series of conscious and unconscious decisions where you can never really know the exact outcome.  For Simon, he reflects that most of his success has been a matter of circumstance rather than following a big plan, and that he\u2019s had few big decision points in his life, most of which were not very difficult decisions for him.  In retrospect, I feel like my life has followed a similar path.  There have only been a few instances where I think I could have taken a very large divergent path but that\u2019s a story for another time.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimon\u2019s autobiography is precisely the type of biography that I like to read, sprinkled with wisdom and insight into his life.  Although, not every chapter was as interesting as the next (e.g. his early childhood), I thoroughly enjoyed his autobiography and would definitely recommend it to anyone\u2019s whose interests intersect the topics above.\n\n\n\n\n\nRadical Candor\n by Kim Scott \n\n\n\n\n\nThis was a management book recommended to me by a friend.  I took it on a short vacation and finished it in a week or so.  It has a lot of great ideas about management.  First Scott\u2019s credentials: she worked at Google and Apple, learning from the great managers such as Sheryl Sandberg and Tim Cook.  She led a large organization at Google and then moved on to lead Apple\u2019s management training program.  My big takeaways from the book are three points:\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Centred\n: To be a good manager, you need to have your own life together.  If you\u2019re burnt out, personal life is a mess or have health issues, there\u2019s no way you can even begin to be a good manager.  The first step to being a good manger is making sure your outside-of-work life is in order so that when you come to work you can focus on work.\nCare Personally\n:\n \nThis is a prerequisite to building trusting relationships: to care personally about your employees (and everyone else you interact with)!  If you don\u2019t have trust with your team, how can you ever hope to help them achieve excellence?  Caring personally doesn\u2019t mean all the superficial things that usually come to mind but rather, genuinely caring about them as a person, including the crazy things that may be going on in their personal life.\nCandid Feedback\n: Building trust is only half the story, to helps your team excel, you need to be able to tell them honestly when they\u2019re doing well, and, just as importantly, when they\u2019re not.  The latter is the hardest part for all managers (me included), and can only really be effective if the other side is actually willing to listen.  This is exactly why you need to build trust or else candid feedback is useless.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the big ideas in the book but of course there\u2019s a lot more.  There are many more anecdotes to give you a better intuition about what these three points mean, as well as more tactical things you can do in situations like 1-1s, meetings, performance reviews and even socials.  I don\u2019t think there will ever be \u201cone\u201d book on management, but this one definitely has a lot of really good ideas, and you\u2019d probably be missing something if you didn\u2019t at least skim through this one.\n\n\n\n\n\nUltralearning\n by Scott H. Young\n\n\n\n\n\nUltralearning is a term (as far as I can tell) made up by Young to describe learning a new topic or skill incredibly fast usually by self-directed learning utilizing a common toolkit of methods.  His claim to fame is the MIT Challenge where he successfully completed (approximately) the MIT computer science undergrad curriculum in about a year.  Other accomplishments were that he learned four languages to a roughly intermediate level within a year (including Chinese and Korean), and also learned to sketch faces pretty well within a month (without any prior art training).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe book itself is pretty typical for these types of books: chalk full on anecdotes in between the clearly labelled ideas of how to learn really fast.  Most of the anecdotes weren\u2019t really that interesting to me since they were either about people who were extreme outliers (like himself) who dedicate all their time to learning or mythical figures like Richard Feynman.  It\u2019s difficult to relate to either of these two situations because I\u2019m not in those categories.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the really great part of the book was all of the strategies and tactics on how to learn.  This was particularly inspiring because I\u2019ve more recently (as an adult at least) gone through struggles learning two new skills: music (guitar and singing) and Chinese.  After graduate school, I started learning both of these in earnest and it has been a challenge.  I\u2019ve made decent progress with some great teachers but much of the real progress comes from work you do outside of the lesson.  Having thought of ways to improve the efficiency of learning, I\u2019ve stumbled upon a few of the techniques mentioned in this book.  It also gave me a few extra ideas on how I could accelerate the learning.  Here are some interesting ones:\n\n\n\n\n\nMeta-learning: Researching the most effective ways to learn \nhow to learn\n a skill/topic\nTactics to deal with procrastination or finding time to learn\nDirectly practicing the skill you want to learn (e.g. focus directly on practicing speaking a language if that\u2019s your goal, not reading/writing)\nSpaced repetition\nFocused practice \u2014 identify and drill your weaknesses (related to importance of good feedback)\nIntuition is build through deep work on problems where you have time to \u201cstruggle\u201d\nUtilize experimentation and the scientific method once you start to enter mastery territory\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve actually picked up many of these things at one point or another to varying degrees.  The one thing that I have not be doing well is the directness aspect, I usually favor the practicing techniques that are either convenient or familiar, which I have learned usually plateaus my learning relatively quickly.  That\u2019s why it\u2019s good to read sources like this: to get new ideas about \nhow to learn\n so that you can do it more efficiently.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, I\u2019d recommend skimming this book and looking out for new ideas about how to learn faster.  I doubt many people will attempt some of the more extreme learning challenges but I\u2019m sure most people will find a hint or two on how to improve their learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\n2020 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2019/12/book-impressions-2019-q4/"}

{"title": "Book Impressions \u2014 2019-Q3", "content": "Book Impressions \u2014 2019-Q3\n\t\t\n\nThe Demon Under the Microscope\n by Thomas Hager\n\n\n\n\n\nOften times we get so caught up in the latest technological advances that we don\u2019t think about all the discoveries that came before us.  This book is  about perhaps one of the most important discoveries of the 20th century: antibiotics.\n\n\n\n\n\nHager does a masterful job weaving between different story lines about the search for antibiotics.  As the subtitle suggests, we are taken from the trenches of World War I to Nazi research facilities (sort of).  The one thing he does incredibly well is provide a narrative involving the \nindividuals\n: the scientists (and bureaucrats) who, though all their flaws, make progress toward discovering the first antibiotics.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing that the book clearly describes, and something I never really put thought into, is how deadly bacteria can be.  Something as simple as strep throat, an accidental cut on a stone in the garden or giving birth could easily lead to an terminal infection.  Millions of people died from these \u201csimple\u201d infections.  Nowadays, these problems are just an afterthought because we\u2019ve discovered a panacea in antibiotics.\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides all the more scientific details, the thing I appreciated most about the book is the humanization of the whole endeavor.  One of the \u201cprotagonists\u201d, Domagk, was a brilliant scientist who methodically tested hundreds (if not thousands) of drugs that eventually led to the (accidental) discovery of sulpha (the first antibiotic).  However, it was clear that he was just human.  He was worried about money, status, and his family.  He became depressed at various points in his life, was conflicted about Nazi Germany, and jealous of competing researchers who soon after discovered a much more effective sulpha variant that was lying under his nose.\n\n\n\n\n\nOften we forget that the most brilliant of us are just regular people with hopes and dreams and just doing the best they can.  We idolize Einstein or (in my case) Munger but they too were/are just humans.  It\u2019s a bit of relief to know that the problems and worries that you have also afflicted the best of us.  It\u2019s obvious when you think about it but it\u2019s always nice to get a reminder and to humanize those whom we put on a pedestal.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, Hager writes a great narrative about one of the most important discoveries of the 20th century that really gives life to the great minds behind the discovery.  Go read it!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy We Sleep\n by Matthew Walker\n\n\n\n\n\nIf someone told you that there was something you could do that could simultaneously make you look more attractive, healthier, and smarter, you\u2019d probably think they were a scam artist, right?  Well that thing does exist and it\u2019s sleep!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy We Sleep \nis an easily accessible book on everything to do with sleep.  It covers a broad spectrum of topics such as sleep\u2019s function (as we understand it today), health benefits, disorders, dreaming, societal impacts, and, in particular, how to sleep better.  A theme throughout the book (surprise, surprise) is that sleep is \nvery\n \nimportant\n.  What I found most interesting is \nwhy\n it\u2019s so important.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo interesting models (I use the term model because we don\u2019t know \nexactly\n how sleep works yet) that I learned:\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two \nindependent\n processes going on when you get tired: a circadian rhythm and a sleep drive process.  The circadian rhythm is your biological clock, it cycles roughly with day and night.  It causes you to be more awake during the daytime and exerts little pressure to be awake at nighttime.  The sleep drive process has the opposite effect. As you stay awake, your brain releases a chemical adenosine that gradually builds up and causes you to be more sleepy but gets purged when you get a good night\u2019s sleep (caffeine inhibits the effect of adenosine).  Your peak sleepiness will occur when your circadian rhythm is low but your level of adenosine is high, which typically should be at night time.  This explains some common phenomenon such as having a \u201csecond wind\u201d after pulling an all nighter (circadian rhythm), jet lag (circadian rhythm), or usage of caffeine to stay awake (sleep drive).\nSleep has two (sort of) distinct phases: non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM), and rapid eye movement sleep (REM).  REM sleep is the shallower sleep state where we dream, while NREM is a deep sleep state.  Every night we cycle between REM and NREM several times, with NREM being more prevalent earlier in the night (deep sleep) with REM being more dominant as morning approaches.  One of NREM\u2019s primary functions is to take everything in our short term memory and store it in our longer term memory, kind of like filing things away.  REM\u2019s corresponding function is to make connections between all of the things we\u2019ve learned, the metaphorical creative side.  Of course, getting enough sleep is critical to ensuring both of these processes occur to make you smarter.  However, what\u2019s not obvious is that the proportion of NREM and REM sleep you get is pretty consistent with respect to the \ntime\n of day (controlled by your circadian rhythm).  So if you are going to bed 2 hour later than usual but still get the same 8 hours of sleep, you are going to get \nless \nNREM sleep.  So it\u2019s important to both sleep a solid 8 hours but also at the right time!\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides these two important models of sleep, Walker goes on to espouse the myriad of benefits of sleep (as well as myriad of disorders due to lack of sleep).  In our 24-hour screen society, it\u2019s becoming so much harder to get a good night\u2019s rest, and Walker attempts to educate and warn us of the perils of missed sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this book, I definitely recommend it.  It\u2019s easy to read with a huge amount of information.  Personally, I\u2019ve been practicing much better sleep habits since I read the book including a more consistent sleep schedule, no screen time before bed, cooler room temperature, and relaxation before bed (no work).  If I still haven\u2019t convinced you to read it, just sleep on it, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll make the right choice in the morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Examined Life\n by Stephen Grosz\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter I read the the previous books, I wanted something lighter.  Sometimes I get into a mood where I just don\u2019t feel like using my left brain and instead switch to my right.  Outside of fiction, this book is probably in that latter category.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had already read this book last year, so this was a re-read.  Definitely a sign of a good book.  You can check out my previous impression here: \nhttps://briankeng.com/2019/01/2018-year-in-review/\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only additional thing that I\u2019ll add is that humans are complex, and so are their psychological disorders.  We all suffer from some disorder to some degree.  It\u2019s eye opening to see the extreme ends of the spectrum in this book but it has also allowed me to reflect on my own behaviors and of those  around me.  And in particular, I think it\u2019s allowed me to be a bit more understanding when people behave irrationally.  And who doesn\u2019t want a bit more understanding?\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2019 Year-In-Review\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2017 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2019/09/book-impressions-2019-q3/"}
{"title": "Book Impressions \u2014 2019-Q2", "content": "Book Impressions \u2014 2019-Q2\n\t\t\n\nBad Blood by John Carreyrou\n\n\n\n\n\nThis book tells the story of the meteoric rise and fall of Theranos, the Silicon Valley unicorn that claimed to have technology that could analyze blood samples with just a few drops of blood.  It\u2019s written by the Wall Street Journal reporter who broke the original piece exposing them as a fraud so it had an in-depth view of the whole situation stitched together from numerous sources (including himself).\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a really interesting story outlining the mania that can happen in Silicon Valley startups when you mix a charismatic founder, a world-changing idea,  powerful connections, and cheap VC money.  This is really a case of life being stranger from fiction.  The dysfunction that occurred at Theranos is just simply unbelievable considering they raised more than $700 million and peaked at over 800 employees with almost no revenue.  Here are just a list of some of the ridiculous things that happened:\n\n\n\n\n\nElizabeth Holmes idolized Steve Jobs so much so she started wearing black turtlenecks as her uniform.\nShe also would consciously speak in a deep baritone, a few octaves below her real vocal range to have more presence.\nEmployees at Theranos were compartmentalized so much so that the technicians trying to work on the blood tests and the engineers building the actual device were only allowed to communicate through Holmes and her inner circle.\nShe had 5-star generals, former secretaries of state and billionaire CEOs on her board of directors, none of whom had any doubts that Holmes had build a revolutionary technology (in fact, they defended her from any criticism).\nAny criticism from employees would result in immediate termination and a team of the country\u2019s most powerful lawyers threatening lawsuits (the same ones who dealt with the Microsoft anti-trust case, Al Gore\u2019s presidential recount case, and more recently, Harvey Weinstein\u2019s accusations) and other intimidation tactics like having them being followed around by private investigators.\nSome patients in Arizona actually received false blood tests for things as serious a syphilis or HIV.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s an incredibly interesting story and the unbelievable part is how Holmes was able to systematically convince the whole world that her technology actually worked \u2014 including the employees at Theranos who could plainly see that it wasn\u2019t working \u2014 and, more importantly, how she wasn\u2019t exposed for \nyears\n.  We still don\u2019t know if she actually believed that she was changing the world or it was just a big con.  Either way, this book is definitely worth a read.\n\n\n\n\n\nShoe Dog by Phil Knight\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a great book!  I heard great things about it and I took it with me on  vacation and devoured it.  It\u2019s an autobiography from the founder of Nike, Phil Knight, detailing his (and Nike\u2019s) incredible journey from nothing to IPO.  It\u2019s written in an easy-to-read, more informal style.  Knight is a great story teller (which is what makes it hard to put down) and also sprinkles in loads of wisdom and insight along the way.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason why I liked the book the most is because I can identify with a lot of the ups and downs he has had while building Nike.  Being part of a startup from early days to (hopefully) success is a unique experience that is hard to describe.  \nShoe Dog\n does a great job of conveying that feeling and putting a lot of perspective on the whole experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some random thoughts from the book that stood out for me:\n\n\n\n\n\nCrises\n!  Boy were there a lot of them!  It seemed at almost every turn there was a new crisis where Nike was on the brink of collapse.  I think one of the most important things Knight captured in this book is the mood and feeling of those crises.  When you have an early stage startup, it really is touch-and-go where the whole thing can come crumbling down at a moment\u2019s notice.  Having this view into one of the most successful companies in the world, and knowing they also experienced the same thing, has given me so much perspective.\nCashflow is king!\n  Among the many crises that Nike had, chief among them were cashflow problems.  Sometimes us in technology don\u2019t think about this much because the marginal cost of producing software is zero (you can just copy it), but when you actually have to manufacture a physical good, you need enough cash to bridge the time between paying supplies and actually selling the final good to your customers.  On top of this, when you\u2019re growing extremely fast (doubling sales every year) your need for cash is magnified (more cash is tied up paying suppliers but before you have made the sale to the end customer).  In the 70s, venture capital was almost non-existent save some early efforts in Silicon Valley, so Nike had to turn to borrowing from friends and family, the bank, and its suppliers.  You might thing that everyone would love to invest in a high-growth startup but the banks, being conservative institutions, actually wanted them to \nslow\n their growth!  With VC money coming easy nowadays, it\u2019s easy to forget that it wasn\u2019t always like this.\nTrade-offs\n: The other thing that was apparent was the trade-off Knight made between between family life and business.  Nike was all consuming for him (and many early employees) and had dramatic effects on his personal life.  He admits that his relationship with his sons could have been better and that his wife also put up with a lot.  I think this is  the harsh reality of building these companies.  You have a fixed number of hours in a day and if you\u2019re going to build a new company, it\u2019s going to take up a huge portion of your time, not to mention your mental energy.  Life is full of trade-offs and we shouldn\u2019t fool ourselves into thinking otherwise.\nCompetition\n: Throughout their history Nike dealt with some shady businesses both in Japan and America.  When you have your primary manufacturer plotting behind your back to drop you, and your competition lobbying the government to tax you to bankruptcy, it\u2019s hard to survive!  We like to think that modern economies are relatively fair meritocracies but lots of shady stuff still goes on.\nManiacs\n: Knight had built a team of \u201cmaniacs\u201d!  This diverse group of misfits (his words), who were just as fanatical as he was, really pushed Nike to success.  I would wager that this is probably a recurring them for most super successful companies.\nBias\n: Throughout the book Knight acknowledged some of his mistakes related to some shady stuff they did (stealing documents from Japanese business partners) to his absence on the home front.  It\u2019s great that he included some less favourable views of himself but ultimately, humans will be humans.  I did feel that most of these events had a very positive spin on them but it\u2019s interesting to see how we interpret our own mistakes. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, great book, go read it.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrust Me I\u2019m Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator by Ryan Holiday\n\n\n\n\n\nI think I came across this book in the comments section of Hacker News.  The person who recommended it was effusive that it was worth a read, I usually try to pay attention when I hear something like that.  Suffice it to say, this book is a definite recommendation from me.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe author, Ryan Holiday, used to run marketing at American Apparel and now consults on various branding and marketing campaigns, particularly in the new age of internet media.  The premise of the book is pretty simple: the instant gratification, free, and always on incentives of the internet has created a situation where it\u2019s very easy to manipulate the general public into believing something false.  Not only that, the first half of the book goes on to show you example after example of how he (and others) were able to accomplish it.  The second part of the book then goes on to show the dark consequences of this brave new world of media manipulation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interesting part about this book is that the original edition was published in 2012!  This was well before \u201cfake news\u201d became a common part of our vernacular or the awareness of foreign manipulation of democratic elections.  At that time, Holiday basically gave a playbook on how manipulate the media and the public (although not specifically for interfering with elections).  I don\u2019t know about you, but I certainly like to understand when and how I\u2019m being manipulated. \n\n\n\n\n\nAfter reading this book, I\u2019ve become much more aware that most of the \u201cinteresting\u201d articles I read on the internet are probably half-truths, exaggerations or outright lies.  And for the most part, it\u2019s not malicious by the actual authors of the blog posts, articles or tweets \u2014 it\u2019s more of a necessity based on the economics of internet media.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s take a simple case: you\u2019re a writer for a popular internet news media outlet (or even a traditional one).  Your company makes money by people viewing ads on your website.  This means that the articles on your site need to grab the attention of your audience.  Now keep in mind, the average internet user is a fickle creature.  Anything can easily divert their attention from a new flashy hyperlinked headline to a picture of a cute dog.  So naturally you, as a writer for this site, make your articles with click-baity type headlines, make it simple and short to read (above the fold) and make sure you are the \nfirst\n to actually publish it (who wants to read old news?).  Add on top of this that you get paid by the volume (not quality) of articles you produce, putting you in a state of constant grind to write the next viral article.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of these facts lead to our current state of internet news: barely researched articles based on a single source, exaggerated and misrepresented to get you to click.  An exaggeration?  Maybe but probably not too far off.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf that weren\u2019t bad enough, this internet news cycle makes it incredibly easy to \u201csuggest\u201d news to these people in order to get your story to the top.  I won\u2019t go into too much detail (you should read the book) but if you sat down and thought hard about it, you probably could come up with a handful of ways to do it yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyways, this book is definitely worth your time to read.  It\u2019s a pretty easy read and the anecdotes about manipulation are both interesting and a bit appalling at the same time \u2014 just what you would expect from Holiday. \n\n\n\n\n\nBooks Started but Paused\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are a couple of books that I started to read but put down because I wasn\u2019t getting into them.  I saw an interview by the author of \nFarnam Street\n who said that we all should get over the need to finish books.  You should decide what you want to get out of it, if you got what you wanted out of it but didn\u2019t finish it (or you\u2019re not getting what you want out of it), then stop reading it.  There\u2019s no shame in that, instead it\u2019s just rational (we\u2019re not in school anymore, we don\u2019t get marks for finishing books).  Anyways, here are a couple of books in that category:\n\n\n\n\n\nRetail Disruptors: The Spectacular Rise and Impact of the Hard Discounters by Jan-Benedict Steenkamp and Laurens Sloot\n: I actually find the topic very interesting from a business model point of view and also because Rubikloud is in the retail industry.  However, I just wasn\u2019t in the mood to read the book.  It\u2019s a much more academic treatment compared to the above books which are told much more through stories and anecdotes (although I wouldn\u2019t say \nRetail Disruptors\n is dry like academic papers, more like digested research for the mass public).  It\u2019s probably because I was still in the mood for some great story telling that I put it down (coming off of Theranos and Shoe Dog).  I\u2019ll probably pick it up again at some point.\nDeng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China by Ezra F. Vogel\n: I\u2019ve been meaning to learn more about Deng Xiaoping, the successor of Mao who opened up China and started it along a multi-decade growth streak.  The book was ambitious at 900+ pages.  I only got through the first 70 or so, which interestingly covered most of Deng\u2019s life (the last 800 pages covered the last decade or two under Mao and afterwards).  The issue with this type of biography is that it\u2019s very much told as a series of events rather than a story.  I have a hard time getting into these types of books because the whole reason I want to read biographies is to \u201cget to know\u201d the subject, not learn a bunch of facts.  I do understand the difficulty for the author though, Deng was an incredibly secretive fellow, never writing anything down for fear it could be used against him.  On top of that and he grew up in a time of turmoil where record keeping likely wasn\u2019t a priority.  I might end up picking this book up again but I\u2019ll definitely need to be in the right mood to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2019 Year-In-Review\nBook Impressions -- 2019-Q4\n2018 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2019/07/book-impressions-2019-q2/"}
{"title": "Book Impressions \u2013 2019-Q1", "content": "Book Impressions \u2013 2019-Q1\n\t\t\n\nOne of my goals for this year is to read more consistently.  It\u2019s really hard because I\u2019m quite busy, and for the last few years reading has been a bit sporadic for me.  So far I\u2019ve kept up my goal of one book a month (not much, but I\u2019m a pretty busy guy).  So here are my \u201cBook Impressions\u201d, not quite reviews but shorter thoughts on the book as a whole\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Children Succeed: Grit, Curiosity, and the Hidden Power of Character by Paul Tough\n\n\n\n\n\nI thought this book would be primarily about how \u201cgrid, curiosity and the hidden power of character\u201d are the main factors affecting lifelong success.  Although that was one of the main ideas, the approach to explaining it was less interesting for me personally.  The author follows a few different lines of research and stories, mainly revolving around poorer and less fortunate kids in America, and how it is incredibly challenging to teach them to be successful due to their unfortunate circumstances at home or in the community.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was hoping to have a broader understanding of child development from this book, in the context of kids that I interact with (such as my nieces).  The book didn\u2019t quite touch upon these cases as the focus was mainly on helping less fortunate kids, which, of course, is an important challenge, but not what I was hoping for.  Overall, I would say if you\u2019re interested in this subject and the context, it might be something you want to pick up.\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Unintelligence by Meredith Broussard\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was a cute little book that I came across through Twitter (someone posted about it).  The main idea of the book is that artificial intelligence (as it currently stands) has many limitations and the robot revolution isn\u2019t coming any time soon.  This idea is very close to me because most people have the wrong view (in my opinion) of where AI is going \u2014 it\u2019s much less developed than people think, and this book touches on some great points towards this viewpoint.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe author starts off introducing computers, coding and AI/ML, which I mostly skimmed over (it was a good attempt targeted towards non-technical folk but it\u2019s hard to explain difficult concepts concisely).  She then proceeded on to describe several very interesting experiences with AI both as a user and as a creator.  Some memorable ones involve almost dying in a self-driving car and creating an AI for investigative journalism and then telling people about it who then are extremely disappointed it\u2019s not something closer to science fiction.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other main idea she talks about is \ntechnochauvinism\n, which she coins as \u201cthe belief that technology is always the solution\u201d.  I thought this was illustrated very nicely in many different places in the book as well.  The focus isn\u2019t so much why all these silicon valley types are ignorant but rather that we need \nhumans\n in the loop to solve some of our most complex problems (e.g. social, environmental etc.).  This aligns perfectly with my viewpoint on technology.  It\u2019s so seductive to think technology can fix everything but once you start working in the real-world, you\u2019ll realize how messy it is (just ask Bill Gates and his efforts to combat disease).  Overall, I\u2019d definitely recommend this book.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples of Product Development Flow by Donald G. Reinertsen\n\n\n\n\n\nI found this book through a \npost on Erik Berhardsson\u2019s blog\n (highly recommended) a while back and I finally decided to read it.  The main concepts of the book are about how to optimize product development (in the broader sense of the word product e.g. software, consumer good etc.) and the differences from optimizing manufacturing processes.  He attempts to (very loosely) model product development using mathematical or technical models such as queueing theory, economics, network routing etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first few chapters of the book are all over the place because the author doesn\u2019t spend much time defining terms or even clarifying what \u201cproduct\u201d means (I was quite confused).  But\u2026 after getting into the main body, he has many nuggets of wisdom.  His big idea is that we should pay attention to queues (of work) and manage them appropriately.  In particular, shortening queues, having extra capacity and shortening batch sizes are recurring themes.  Another really good idea is to quantify tasks directly in terms of economic value and not secondary metrics like throughput.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe chapters are organized into principles, where each principle has a page or so of description along with some examples.  He covers many different cases in many different forms.  Definitely something to go back and reference later for the particular situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has some strong ideas that can definitely help shape and optimize a product development process.  At first, I was a bit turned off on the \u201chand-wavy\u201d usage of  mathematical models but then I came to appreciate how it at least has \nsome\n foundations in math vs. a pure anecdotal approach.  I wouldn\u2019t take every idea as a law of nature but definitely leverage the ones that make sense and experiment with them.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, a pretty good book and definitely worth a read if you\u2019re thinking about how to optimize a product development flow.\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2019 Year-In-Review\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2020 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2019/03/book-impressions-2019-q1/"}
{"title": "2018 Year-In-Review", "content": "2018 Year-In-Review\n\t\t\nIt\u2019s been a busy year! So much so that I\u2019ve barely even had a weekend to myself to reflect on things. Thankfully, I have a couple of weeks off for the holidays to write this year-in-review. I did this \nlast year\n and I think it was an extremely useful exercise. Sometimes things move so fast that we don\u2019t get a second to stop and think about what\u2019s happened, what\u2019s happening and what\u2019s coming down the road. At least with this year-in-review, I can make sure I do it \nonce\n a year.\n\n\nLast year, I mentioned how I look back at myself and I\u2019m surprised how much I\u2019ve learned (I believe the words I used were \njust how stupid I was\n). Funny thing is these lessons learned are almost never technical, and this year is no different. It\u2019s always something new about human relations or how the way the world works, which really follows what\u2019s really complex in this world \u2014 the people and their interactions. This ignorance removal process (\u00e0 la Buffett and Munger) is what really gets me going and I have to say is one of the big drivers of my modest success. I\u2019m looking forward to a bright 2019 loaded with more ignorance removal and hopefully sprinkled with some wisdom acquisition if I\u2019m lucky.\n\n\nAccomplishments\n\n\nThis has been a pretty good year for me and I\u2019m quite proud of all that I\u2019ve accomplished. Here\u2019s are the highlights.\n\n\nRubikloud\n\n\nThis has been a really big year at Rubikloud (my fourth this past September). We were able to raise our Series B round, which came with a lot of expectations on growth. It wasn\u2019t easy but I\u2019ve built a great team of data scientists and machine learning engineers, essentially doubling the team size from last year. All the while, I\u2019ve been learning how to step into bigger shoes being a manager of managers: setting expectations for my teams, getting cross functional teams working properly, and most important of all making sure that I don\u2019t forget about the people involved. It\u2019s by no means an easy task and there is still a ton that I\u2019m learning. I do have to give a shout out to the \nRaw Signal Group\n.\u00a0 All the managers at Rubikloud attended their amazing Leadership Workshop where Johnathan and Melissa Nightingale taught us that people managing is a serious skill, that it can be learned, and that it\u2019s not easy! I\u2019m really fortunate that I\u2019ve had the opportunity to grow along side Rubikloud because I couldn\u2019t even imagine learning and accomplishing a tenth of what I have anywhere else (at least in this short a time).\n\n\nAcademic Research\n\n\nI\u2019m not really a researcher anymore, not since graduate school, which is why it\u2019s so surprising that I have this entry! I\u2019ve had the pleasure of working with a few great graduate students as part of Rubikloud\u2019s data science research internships. This year we were able to publish two papers at the International Workshop on Data Mining for Service (held in conjunction with ICDM):\n\n\n\n\nT. Doan, N. Veira, and B. Keng, \u201cGenerating Realistic Sequences of Customer-level Transactions for Retail Datasets\u201d\n\n\nT. Chen, B. Keng, and J. Moreno, \u201cMultivariate Arrival Times with Recurrent Neural Networks for Personalized Demand Forecasting\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThese papers are applied academic papers relevant to a couple of topics we\u2019re interested in at Rubikloud. I\u2019m incredibly proud that we were able to get them published (retail isn\u2019t a popular topic now a days!) I thought that my days writing academic papers were long gone, but I guess not!\n\n\nAdjunct Professor at Rotman School of Management\n\n\nThis was even more unexpected than the research papers that I co-authored. This past summer, I was appointed as an Adjunct Professor in Data Science at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. My responsibilities include helping shape the data science education and research through my work at the Management Data and Analytics Lab, the Master of Management Analytics program and interactions with faculty and students. I was extremely fortunate that Rotman has recently decided to push their data science and analytics capabilities and my experience building AI systems for enterprise companies was a good fit. This is one of those opportunities that came out of left field.\n\n\nA friend at work happened to be having dinner with one of the vice dean\u2019s at Rotman who was good friends with his mentor. At this meeting, the vice dean mentioned that he wanted to connect with some AI experts. My friend recommended me, and the vice dean and I got to talking. Coincidentally, before our meeting he read my blogs (personal and technical) and was particularly impressed with my ethos on learning and my explanations of variational autoencoders. After a few more meetings, he recommended me to meet a couple of other professors who just happened to be overseeing the Master\u2019s of Management Analytics program. They happened to be looking for someone with industry experience in AI to help complement the academic instructors they had already gathered. A few more meetings later, I had a contract and a letter from the dean appointing me as an adjunct professor.\n\n\nThis little event shows how success is really preparation meeting opportunity. I\u2019ve been writing on my blog for years with no immediate rewards (except learning for myself, which is really the only reason I do it). However, the right opportunity just happened to come along where my blog turned out to be incredibly useful. There\u2019s no guarantee of success in this world because there is luck involved (e.g. the right opportunity) but you can definitely increase your chances with preparation and hard work. (As a side note, I find looking at things probabilistically a much better model of the world.)\n\n\nThis part-time position is in addition to my full-time job at Rubikloud, and one that often keeps me busy on the evenings and weekends. This is the main reason why I don\u2019t have many new posts on either my personal or technical blog. Despite the large time commitment, I\u2019m really enjoying having one foot back in academia (and not from the student\u2019s point of view).\n\n\nBlogging\n\n\nThis year I\u2019ve undershot my goals for posting. In particular, there were a couple of ideas I wanted to post on my personal blog and half a dozen more on my technical. I was able to pump out six technical blog posts this year though, three of which I\u2019m particularly proud of on tensors, manifolds, and hyperbolic geometry. All very complex topics especially if you\u2019re learning them through self-study! Hopefully, things will move into steady-state for Rotman and Rubikloud (unlikely) and I\u2019ll have more time to write but I\u2019m not getting my hopes up.\n\n\nMusic and Chinese\n\n\nThese are my two main hobbies, and I\u2019ve made \nsome\n progress on them. For the amount of time that I put in, I\u2019m pretty happy with the result. I think I\u2019m hitting that point where I\u2019ve learned most of the \u201ceasy\u201d stuff and now I\u2019m starting to hit the \u201clong-tail\u201d (this is one of the topics I wanted to write about). For music, I think it\u2019s really solidifying some of the basics like pitch and rhythm, which should directly transfer to singing and playing at the same time. For Chinese, it\u2019s really learning that long-tail of words beyond everyday simple conversation. Finding time is probably the hardest thing for me nowadays but I\u2019m hopeful that I can make steady (if slow) progress on these two hobbies.\n\n\nHealth and Fitness\n\n\nDue to the busy schedule that I have, health and fitness are usually not on the top of my list. My one saving grace is that my wife convinced me to start a personal trainer last year and he has been the main reason why I\u2019m in \ndecent\n shape. I only train with him once a week but boy that 1 hour is pretty killer. The one big quantitative gain that I\u2019ve seen has been in my pull-ups. In the past, I struggled doing even one (I\u2019ve always been pretty bottom heavy). But recently, I\u2019ve consistently doing three at a time! Okay, I know\u2026 not spectacular, but it\u2019s pretty surprising to me. Hopefully, I\u2019ll be writing about this next year with a much bigger number.\n\n\nFailures\n\n\nPerhaps more important than discussing my achievements, failures are where I can work on ignorance removal.\u00a0 It\u2019s important because I (like most people) have a tendency to gloss over failures because it\u2019s embarrassing to see how stupid I was.\u00a0 But it\u2019s precisely because of this tendency that it\u2019s even more important to focus on them so that I can learn.\n\n\nBuilding and Overseeing Multiple Cross-Functional Teams\n\n\nIn my mind, this topic has got to be my biggest failure for the year.\u00a0 While I can\u2019t get into all the details, I\u2019ll say this: scaling a data science team at a startup is hard!\u00a0 At the beginning of the year, the data science team at Rubikloud was a handful of people working on probably two distinct projects; now it\u2019s more than a dozen, and we\u2019re working on half a dozen different projects (not all distinct though).\u00a0 Moreover, these projects involve not just data science but engineering, analytics, client solutions, product, and the list goes on.\u00a0 There are two big things that I took for granted: cross-functional teams and their oversight.\n\n\nIt\u2019s funny that I took cross-functional teams for granted because at the start of 2018 I had just finished reading Andy Grove\u2019s \nHigh Output Management\n (great book), which has a chapter specifically on this topic (\nHybrid Organizations\n)!\u00a0 At the time though, we didn\u2019t have that problem because we were still relatively small.\u00a0 There\u2019s so much less communication overhead when the team is small, and so much less context switching that happens when you have fewer projects.\u00a0 The major issue with cross functional teams is (duh!): how to get different functional members to work together effectively.\u00a0 The complication is that our organization\u2019s reporting lines are primarily functional (data/product engineering, data science, analytics etc.), while our working teams are cross-functional.\u00a0 This means that while each function is very tightly knit, we have to do more work cross-teams.\n\n\nWithout getting into all the details, I think the main thing I learned is that you have to put in \nmuch\n \nmore\n work to make cross-functional teams work (I suppose if you had mission oriented teams, you would have the opposite problem at the function level).\u00a0 This wasn\u2019t so much a problem when you\u2019re small with only one or two projects.\u00a0 Everyone knows each other, you have shared context and you don\u2019t really need to spend much time on it.\u00a0 Once you get bigger, you can\u2019t rely on that shared context because the teams are often newly formed; don\u2019t have a founding team member leading the project because we\u2019ve doubled in size; and, to be honest, much more pressure because of the increased venture funding.\u00a0 I suppose most high-growth startups deal with this at one point or another, that\u2019s why it\u2019s so interesting.\n\n\nThe other big issue is the oversight of many different cross-functional project teams.\u00a0 I\u2019m primarily responsible for the data science aspect of a project but also (of course) concerned about the overall success.\u00a0 The main issue from my point of view is that I need to be able to clearly articulate what results I want to see (not necessarily how to get them though) at frequent enough checkpoints so that I can give feedback to the on-going data science projects but \u2014 and here\u2019s the key point \u2014 without being on the project team!\u00a0 When you\u2019re small, you of course are elbow-deep in all the on-going projects, as you get bigger this is just not feasible.\u00a0 The hard part, especially with regards to data science, is that I still need to define the \u201crequirements\u201d of the data science function.\u00a0 This is not easy because (contrary to Kaggle competitions) it\u2019s not \nonly\n some fixed metric that we\u2019re chasing after.\u00a0 Additionally, the difficulty from a management point of view is getting a good read on the progress of the project (which is usually very non-linear) and giving feedback on the results at frequent intervals.\n\n\nFor both of these issues, we\u2019ve done some pretty good work on improving them that I probably won\u2019t share here because of the company-specific details.\u00a0 But you can check back next year to see if this still tops the list of my failures!\n\n\nDe-Stressing\n\n\nOne of the big issues that I\u2019m still struggling with is getting a routine to de-stress.\u00a0 The pressure of a high-growth startup combined with my additional duties at Rotman have really put a lot on my plate.\u00a0 I spend a lot of my previously free time on Rotman work, which I do enjoy, but it leaves less time to relax.\u00a0 In particular, one issue I have is that I often wake-up in the middle of the night and my mind is thinking about a problem causing me to have difficulty going back to sleep.\u00a0 This (obviously) happens much more often when I do work right before bed.\n\n\nLast year, I already cut out a lot of caffeine (no caffeine after lunch), and as I mentioned above I have a more consistent workout schedule.\u00a0 One goal for the new year is that I need to work out more often.\u00a0 Once a week (even if it\u2019s intense) doesn\u2019t really cut it to de-stress.\u00a0 I need that \u201cworkout high\u201d more often to let my mind relax and get my body tired.\u00a0 Related to this is obviously diet too, which is a hard one for me because I really like junk food (especially sweets).\n\n\nThe other (also obvious) thing that I need to do is to have more downtime before bed.\u00a0 This means I need to be more efficient and/or shift work earlier in the day (e.g. morning).\u00a0 I\u2019m trying to shift all the random things I do like read internet news or hobbies to later in the evening, while moving \u201cwork\u201d earlier in the day.\u00a0 This way I get a break for my mind to rest before I sleep.\n\n\nThese two things are probably my main tactics but I\u2019ll experiment and try others as I find them.\u00a0 These two are simple things but, as usual, easier said than done.\u00a0 I do have good motivation though because I really do like having a good night\u2019s sleep!\n\n\nRelationships: Family and Friends\n\n\nThe other big gap in my goals is relationships: spending more time with family and friends.\u00a0 When it\u2019s not busy, I see my friends and family at regular cadences.\u00a0 With family it\u2019s usually weekly or bi-weekly.\u00a0 My friends are a different story.\u00a0 With one group, we try to at least meet once a month or else we find that we go for months on end without seeing each other.\u00a0 For another group, it\u2019s actually been months!\u00a0 I think the once a month idea is great and I really should keep it up.\u00a0 It\u2019s much harder to keep up with because everyone\u2019s so busy, not the least of which is me!\u00a0 Still, this is an important part of my life and \nit should get the attention it deserves\n.\u00a0 So I\u2019m definitely going to make progress on this in the coming year.\n\n\nHabits\n\n\nLast year, I wrote about a \nfew habits\n that I\u2019ve been trying to pick up.\u00a0 I think I\u2019ve regressed on at least a couple of them.\u00a0 For the best hour of the day (first hour after I wake up), I\u2019ve been slacking for the past half year or so, partly because I\u2019ve been working like crazy at Rubikloud, partly because I use that time to work on Rotman work too.\u00a0 I still think it\u2019s valuable though (why give it away to others when I can keep it to myself?), so I\u2019m going to change that.\u00a0 Hopefully that will translate to more posts (either here or on the technical side).\n\n\nAs for the flashcards, I stopped midway through last year.\u00a0 Once I got to a couple thousand flashcards, even with spaced repetition, I found that I had too many to do in one day and I got frustrated.\u00a0 I also guessed that it outlived its usefulness as a learning tool \u2014 I was wrong.\u00a0 I do think I had to change the way I was using them though.\u00a0 Two big ideas: (1) don\u2019t start adding random words, only add words you\u2019ve experienced (read or heard in context) or else you won\u2019t be able to use it properly; (2) I started also practicing to form a sentence with the word and ghost writing it, in addition to just recognizing it.\u00a0 Using it actively in a sentence is really the most important part, while ghost writing helps with remembering it (I don\u2019t intend to hand-write Chinese anytime soon).\u00a0 I\u2019ve also reset my flashcards and I\u2019m starting from scratch.\u00a0 This means a lot of the \u201ceasy\u201d words are gone from my deck.\u00a0 Hopefully this clean slate will also help adoption.\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\n: Again, this year I haven\u2019t spent much time reading books.\u00a0 One of them, again, I spent reading over Christmas break.\u00a0 It\u2019s either because I feel guilty I haven\u2019t read much or because I actually have the time.\u00a0 Anyways here is the list with a few comments about them.\n\n\n\n\nMy Life (Bill Clinton)\n: A while ago I heard a friend say good things about Clinton\u2019s biography so I decided to pick it up.\u00a0 It\u2019s quite interesting.\u00a0 Bill Clinton is obviously a very complex man.\u00a0 What struck me is that his thinking was quite rational and that he was much more focused on the economy than some of his successors.\u00a0 He did after all oversee a big economic boom that actually took the government budget into surplus.\u00a0 The other interesting thing from a historical perspective is how harshly the Republican opposition was hounding him about some alleged campaign spending misappropriations.\u00a0 In fact, they appointed an incredibly biased special council who intimidated (via expensive lawyer fees) his friends and colleagues who might be suspected in the scandal.\u00a0 Time after time finding nothing related to the initial investigation, they finally stumbled upon his sex scandal.\u00a0 On the surface, you can superficially see a lot of similarities to today\u2019s special council investigation.\u00a0 It\u2019s interesting that what feels like such a big deal with the current situation, played out in a very similar way a couple decades ago.\u00a0 The problem is people my age would have no sense of that unless they\u2019ve read up on the past.\u00a0 That\u2019s at least one reason why reading about history is important: it gives you a lot of perspective on current situations (it\u2019s not predictive though).\n\n\nTen Great Ideas About Chance (Persi Diaconis & Brian Skyrms)\n: This is a book that was recommended to me by a friend at work.\u00a0 It\u2019s literally what the title suggests: going back to some of the earliest ideas about probability all the way to modern implications of it in computing and physics.\u00a0 The book starts off slow then gets really deep into mathematics.\u00a0 Depending on the chapter, complex notation and ideas are jumped into without much reference to building up the background.\u00a0 This is definitely not a book for general audiences but rather someone with university-level mathematical training.\u00a0 For a couple of the chapters closer to the end, the mathematics went above my level, so definitely not for the faint of heart.\u00a0 Overall, I thought the book was just \u201cok\u201d.\u00a0 I like the idea of explaining big ideas in mathematics but I would have hoped it would be more accessible and, in particular, give me a more intuitive and clear way to think about these big ideas.\u00a0 It was able to accomplish it for some of the chapters but not others, especially not for the more math heavy ones in the back half.\n\n\nThe Manager\u2019s Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change (Camille Fournier)\n: This is a recommendation I got from one of \nErik Berhardsson\n\u2018s post (great blog by the way).\u00a0 It\u2019s probably one of the best technical-focused management books out there right now.\u00a0 It details all aspects of leadership and management from tech lead all the way to CTO.\u00a0 For each one, Camille outlines the responsibilities, \u201cgotchas\u201d, and gives insight to what the role entails.\u00a0 Most new to management (not just technical) haven\u2019t studied this in school and haven\u2019t even had any training on it!\u00a0 This is nuts because it\u2019s probably one of the most important roles in a company.\u00a0 There are key ideas at the strategic, tactical and day-to-day level that are important for managers, and especially technical managers, which I do think require special treatment.\u00a0 I like it so much I\u2019ve actually bought a few copies for my colleagues so that they can use it.\u00a0 I\u2019d definitely recommend this book to anyone who is even thinking about moving into a technical leadership role, whether that\u2019s just mentoring an intern or becoming a VP of Engineering.\n\n\nSapiens (Yuval Noah Harari)\n: I\u2019ve heard a bunch of good things about this book and so I decided to pick it up before a flight at the airport.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very accessible book, easy to read and written in an engaging manner.\u00a0 It\u2019s thesis is about \u201cshared fiction\u201d that we humans create in order to work together in large groups from companies to cities to societies.\u00a0 All of these things around us (e.g. the concept of money, society, country etc.) are all really just \u201cfiction\u201d in the sense that there\u2019s no physical representation of it but he convincingly shows that these abstractions are necessary in order for us to be able to work in large groups together.\u00a0 The \u201cfiction\u201d label for me is a bit extreme (although definitely eye-catching), I view them more as \u201cabstractions\u201d but maybe that\u2019s only because I come from a computing background.\u00a0 Anyways, the majority of the book is actually a detailed run-through of human history (back from pre-historic times), which is always an interesting subject.\u00a0 Nothing was particularly new to me because I\u2019ve read a lot of this before in Guns, Germs and Steel and probably some others that I can\u2019t quite remember.\u00a0 It was good to get a refresher and it was a very engaging read (at least compared to Guns, Germs and Steel in my opinion).\u00a0 Definitely recommend it to those who haven\u2019t read much about human history.\n\n\nMastering the Market Cycle (Howard Marks)\n: Howard Marks is widely considered one of the great value investors of our time.\u00a0 He\u2019s respected by those in the community including Warren Buffett.\u00a0 Buffett actually convinced him to write his first book (which is also great).\u00a0 A lot of the ideas in his books (including this one) arise from his memos, which are freely \navailable online\n.\u00a0 In this book, he goes in depth into market cycles, what causes them, and how to approximately deal with them.\u00a0 If you\u2019ve been reading his previous material, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything too surprising but one thing I like very much is his focus on uncertainty; in other words, probability.\u00a0 Every outcome is one of the many possible outcomes, and it\u2019s important to understand the many possible outcomes, not just the observed ones.\u00a0 For example, I wouldn\u2019t say that I\u2019ve good at picking lottery numbers just because I won.\u00a0 Marks\u2019 writing style is very accessible and the ideas are clearly laid out.\u00a0 Definitely worth a quick read for any value investor.\n\n\nThe Examined Life (Stephen Grosz)\n: This is a book my wife found in the Harvard book store on a short vacation we had to Boston.\u00a0 This is probably the \nmost\n engaging book I\u2019ve read on psychology.\u00a0 The book is a collection of short (anonymized) true stories from a psychoanalyst and his patients.\u00a0 It\u2019s written in a super engaging manner from the point of view of the author (the psychoanalyst).\u00a0 The most interesting part is that he does not try to explicitly impart any lessons after each story.\u00a0 He just leaves the story as is (often without any satisfying resolution) and moves on to the next one.\u00a0 This forces the reader to draw any lessons that may be there for themselves but in the process makes the lesson on human behavior so much more visceral.\u00a0 The stories are incredibly enthralling from things like why we lie to ourselves all the way to how we sabotage ourselves.\u00a0 Bear in mind, all of his patients are very broken people but upon reflection I was able to see resemblances to both myself and those around me.\u00a0 It\u2019s probably one of my favourite books and I would definitely recommend it (we\u2019ve already bought a couple of copies for friends).\n\n\nHow F*cked Up Is Your Management?: An Uncomfortable Conversation about Modern Leadership (Johnathan Nightingale, Melissa Nightingale)\n: This book was given to use during our leadership training with the \nRaw Signal Group\n.\u00a0 The authors were the one giving us the training.\u00a0 It has a bunch of short excerpts on a variety of topics, particularly for smaller, growing tech organizations.\u00a0 It\u2019s got a lot of useful tidbits of information.\u00a0 The one big idea that I really like from the book (paraphrasing): \u201cThe best predictor of an employee\u2019s performance is how well they understand the business.\u201d\u00a0 Good stuff!\u00a0 (Also highly recommend their leadership training.)\n\n\nMeasure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs (John Doerr)\n: This is written by one of the early proponents of the OKR (Objectives and Key Results) system and one of the early backers in Google.\u00a0 He introduced this to Google with great success in the early days and this system has been a popular goal-setting framework for many famous tech companies.\u00a0 The idea of OKRs is excellent, and definitely should be considered if you want to introduce a good framework around goal setting.\u00a0 The book had a lot of interesting anecdotes about OKRs, written by actual people from the companies (e.g. Google, Gates foundation etc.).\u00a0 I thought the treatment of OKRs probably could have been more clear.\u00a0 I\u2019d say this book is good at giving you inspiration to start using OKRs but probably a better way to learn about it is to go through \nRick Klau\u2019s tutorial\n on YouTube.\n\n\nThe Dictator\u2019s Handbook: Why Bad Behavior is Almost Always Good Politics (Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, Alastair Smith)\n: This is one of the best big ideas that I\u2019ve read about in a very long time.\u00a0 The book introduced a very different explanation for why things are the way they are in politics.\u00a0 For example, why do so many scandals happen both in politics and companies?\u00a0 Why do politicians and CEOs alike do things that are counter-productive towards the goals of the country or company?\u00a0 Or even, why does foreign aid more often helps dictators and not the people actually in need.\u00a0 This gives a much more predictive view of why leaders behave badly, which fundamentally starts with the \nincentives\n of leaders: staying in power.\u00a0 What could be more obvious?\u00a0 Anything that they do really starts from that premise.\u00a0 A good overview of the subject is covered by CGP Grey in his video \u201c\nThe Rules for Rulers\n\u201c.\u00a0 Definitely worth reading (especially if you have ambitions of being an authoritarian leader).\n\n\n\n\nThe Coming Year\n\n\nThe coming year is going to be busy for me.\u00a0 Lots of things to do from working at Rubikloud to teaching at Rotman to the long list of things I still want to learn.\u00a0 Good luck to both you and me in 2019!\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2019 Year-In-Review\n2017 Year-In-Review\n2020 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on

{"title": "2017 Year-In-Review", "content": "2017 Year-In-Review\n\t\t\nWith the way the pace of my life is moving, I feel like I haven\u2019t had much time to reflect on longer term accomplishments and lessons.\u00a0 So I thought doing an annual review is a great chance for me to reflect on the past year and figure out what I\u2019m doing right and what I\u2019m dong wrong.\n\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I have looked back at my past self and realized just how \nstupid\n I was.\u00a0 Okay, probably better to put it more positively, I look back at myself and realize how little I knew.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s a testament to my learning ethos, and it\u2019s something that I want to make sure I continue to achieve.\u00a0 So I\u2019m hoping that this annual review will help me with becoming less stupid.\u00a0 Here\u2019s to 2018!\n\n\nAccomplishments\n\n\nI\u2019m quite proud of my accomplishments in 2017.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure the best format to describe these things so I\u2019ve just grouped them into buckets.\n\n\nWork\n\n\nI\u2019m quite proud of the work I did at \nRubikloud\n in 2017.\u00a0 In the past year, I\u2019ve built up a great team of data scientists and we\u2019ve worked together with our incredibly talented product and engineering teams to ship some really cool machine learning products, which are making a huge impact at the businesses of our retail enterprise customers.\u00a0 This is the second startup that I\u2019ve been a part of and I\u2019m still amazed at how much value a small team of motivated individuals can create in such a short period of time (although not without a ton of hard work and chaos).\u00a0 We recently raised a \n$37M Series B\n round led by Intel Capital to scale out our business, so 2018 is definitely going to be an exciting year!\n\n\nTechnical Blog\n\n\nI\u2019m quite proud that I\u2019ve been able to keep up posting on my \ntechnical blog\n (although not so much on my main blog as you can see).\u00a0 I\u2019ve written 8 full-length posts, most of them with some sort of implementation.\u00a0 This has been my primary method for learning about non-work related technical topics.\u00a0 This year I finally started getting into more deep learning topics with a particular focus on a bunch of the various flavours of autoencoders.\u00a0 It\u2019s nice to have an outlet to learn about non-work related topics.\u00a0 It\u2019s very seldom that the work you do at a job aligns precisely with the topics that you\u2019d like to learn about.\u00a0 And while one of the main tangible benefits is a public record of my technical prowess, the reason I can keep it up is that I actually enjoy it a lot!\u00a0 It\u2019s one of those things that I\u2019d keep doing even if I didn\u2019t need to work.\u00a0 Hopefully this year isn\u2019t too crazy that I can\u2019t keep working on it.\n\n\nMusic\n\n\nI\u2019ve been taking guitar lessons for a few years now with an amazing teacher, \nRyan Carr\n.\u00a0 At the end of 2016, we started working toward one of my goals which is to sing and play at the same time.\u00a0 To give some context, when I started singing I had absolutely no sense of tone.\u00a0 That is, I couldn\u2019t match pitch, tell if one note was higher than the other, or otherwise have any \u201cnatural\u201d talent that would be helpful when singing.\u00a0 Despite my lack of talent, I kept practicing (which was especially painful for my wife in the beginning because she has much better tonality than me).\u00a0 It\u2019s quite amazing how far I have progressed.\u00a0 From not having a sense of tone in the beginning, to now where I have at least some vague sense of what\u2019s going on is quite an accomplishment for me.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to describe it because a lot of it is unconscious and through feeling.\u00a0 For someone like me who is used to consciously understanding things, it was (and still is) a big challenge.\u00a0 The big leap of faith is that you keep working at it, knowing that you are \nmaking progress\n even if you can\u2019t see it.\n\n\nChinese\n\n\nI\u2019ve been taking Chinese lessons for the past year or so at this great \nChinese school\n.\u00a0 Some background: for the longest time I\u2019ve had very basic Mandarin skills.\u00a0 Growing up, I had heard it at home and half-heartedly learned it at Saturday school when I was younger but never was able to go beyond a very basic vocabulary, which revolved around things you do around the house (eat, sleep etc.).\u00a0 But after going to this school (1.5 hours every week) for a bit more than a year, I\u2019m quite amazed at how far I have progressed.\u00a0 From barely being able to read 100 or so words, I can now read stories with a vocabulary of somewhere around 1000 words (as long at they\u2019re the right words).\u00a0 And even on the speaking front, I\u2019m much more comfortable (barely) carrying on a conversation, whereas when I started I would frequently get stuck unable to find the right words to express myself (listening was never a major problem for me though so long as it was within my vocabulary).\u00a0 It\u2019s also very gratifying to get external praise.\u00a0 My wife\u2019s family is telling me that I\u2019ve been improving (they speak Mandarin most of the time at home) and one of the Chinese teachers was jokingly saying that I improved much faster than her expectations as well (understandably, I\u2019d have low expectations of myself if I was her as well!).\u00a0 Just like guitar, language is something that is learned unconsciously.\u00a0 At some point, you\u2019re just able to recognize more characters, speak more comfortably, and feel more confident conversing.\u00a0 Of course, it\u2019s still a lot of conscious work reviewing characters daily, memorizing stories, forcing yourself to speak when you know what you\u2019re going to say is wrong.\u00a0 It definitely is a bit of a grind but it\u2019s amazing to see how much one can progress in just a year.\n\n\nFailures\n\n\nFailures are always something that I haven\u2019t had a habit of keeping track of explicitly (actually accomplishments I don\u2019t either unless you count my LinkedIn).\u00a0 But every successful person that I\u2019ve read about says that it\u2019s of vital importance to reflect on them.\u00a0 It shouldn\u2019t be hidden and covered up, rather it should be explicitly stated and encouraged so that we can then improve ourselves, a kind of \u201cde-stupification\u201d process.\u00a0 It\u2019s kind of like finding bugs in software, it\u2019s a behaviour we want to encourage!\u00a0 Finding more bugs, means fixing more bugs, means making the software better!\u00a0 So with that, let\u2019s hope this makes my \u201csoftware\u201d better.\n\n\nStocks\n\n\n\n\nSince 2006 I\u2019ve been managing my own portfolio of stocks.\u00a0 Although, I\u2019ve done better than the index, I\u2019ve also made a huge number of mistakes.\u00a0 The 2017 year in particular has been quite challenging because everything looked quite expensive so my trigger finger was getting itchy (a great recipe for disaster).\u00a0 I\u2019ve know for a long time that \nactivity for activity\u2019s sake yields poor performance\n but knowing something and applying it are two different things.\u00a0 A huge advantage that individuals have over actively managed funds or trading groups at investment banks is \npatience\n.\u00a0 Individuals can wait years (since they\u2019re saving for their retirement after all), while actively managed money needs to show results in months.\u00a0 I recall Charlie Munger mentioning that he sometimes waits years just sitting on cash waiting for the right time to pull the trigger.\n\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been dabbling with options in the past year.\u00a0 In general, leverage is a great way to lose all your money.\u00a0 However, I\u2019ve been reading about a particular trade that involves long dated call options (LEAPs) that is closer to long-term investing rather than gambling.\u00a0 Basically, you use the same logic as picking long term investments except with a bit of leverage.\u00a0 The idea is you just hold the LEAP and roll it over as it comes to expiry to maintain your position in the company.\u00a0 Anyways, over the past couple of years I\u2019ve had a bunch of successful trades with options always buying when the price of a security is way below some rough calculation of intrinsic value for companies I\u2019ve been pretty confident in.\n\n\nHowever, I started venturing out this strategy a bit (again because of my itchy trigger finger) to binary outcome trades (using options or otherwise).\u00a0 Basically when a stock is undervalued dramatically it\u2019s usually due to some terrible news.\u00a0 It could be that the news was overblown and the market will come realize this and the price goes back to a reasonable level, or it could be that the doomsday scenario happens and it goes to zero (or actually anything in between).\u00a0 So I started betting (and notice that I\u2019m using gambling terminology here) on a few of these trades sizing my bets using the \nKelly Criterion\n.\u00a0 So long as my estimation of outcome is in the right ballpark, \nif\n I do a lot of these trades, it should average out to a positive gain.\n\n\nOne of trades is working out (so far), the other I\u2019ve taken a loss.\u00a0 The one that I took a loss on was Chicago Bridge & Iron Company (CBI).\u00a0 My reasoning for\n\ngoing into the stock was not very well thought out.\u00a0 It\u2019s been a stock that has been much talked about on the stock board I follow and it suddenly had a big drop due to poor economic outlook due to a few factors.\u00a0 So I made a bet that it would rebound.\u00a0 However, even at the time it was an ill advised decision because I personally had done very little research into the company.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t even read the latest annual reports or conference call transcripts, all my information came from the stock board.\u00a0 This was a big \nfailure\n \non my part.\u00a0 It\u2019s so easy to get lazy and just buy a stock, but this is exactly what you should be avoiding (especially in a concentrated portfolio like mine).\u00a0 Thankfully, I didn\u2019t bet a big amount because I was not especially confident in the turn around and the Kelly Criterion sizes the bet smaller.\u00a0 I should do well not to buy stocks on a whim but only after thorough analysis (at the very least understanding the business model and the current state of a company\u2019s business).\n\n\nConnecting with People\n\n\nBeing an introvert, I have a harder time than most people connecting with new people.\u00a0 When meeting someone new, it feels like it requires a ton of energy.\u00a0 As a result, I frequently just avoid these types of situations because, quite frankly, they are exhausting.\u00a0 It\u2019s almost as if I have to force myself to be \u201con\u201d to be able to connect with new people.\u00a0 It\u2019s a bit hard to explain the feeling if you\u2019re not an introvert.\n\n\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worthwhile.\u00a0 I think I\u2019ve avoided these situations more in the past year (it waxes and wanes), giving myself excuses such as \u201cI\u2019m tired\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m busy\u201d or worse being apathetic (\u201cI\u2019m not interested in connecting\u201d).\u00a0 This is a \nfailure\n \non my part.\u00a0 Of course, it is worthwhile, it just take a bit more effort.\u00a0 My hypothesis is that like most things, it\u2019s a sort of like a muscle, the more you work on it the better you get.\u00a0 So this is definitely something that I\u2019m going to consciously work in order to reap the benefits of meeting and connecting with the people around me.\n\n\nRationality vs. Relating\n\n\nOne of the things that I definitely need to improve upon is communicating an idea that contradicts with the listener\u2019s point of view.\u00a0 When discussing an issue, sometimes I have a very clear idea about how to approach the solution but it may contradict, negate, or otherwise mismatch with my listener\u2019s point of view.\u00a0 My usual strategy is to just explain it rationally.\u00a0 Sometimes this works, other times not so much.\u00a0 Most people (myself included) feel slighted when someone brings up an idea that is dissonant with their world view.\u00a0 It\u2019s difficult to suppress that feeling and rationally look at a problem.\u00a0 In those cases, sometimes I still push forward with my rational explanation strategy, a \nfailure\n on my part as a communicator.\u00a0 I think a better alternative is to understand where the other person is coming from, start from there and then lead them to my solution.\u00a0 It\u2019s much harder because you actually have to \nunderstand the other person\n.\u00a0 It\u2019s not natural for me but like the one above, I\u2019m of the belief that the more I practice the better I\u2019m going to get at it.\n\n\nIn a similar vein, when giving feedback to someone, no one likes to hear the feedback straight up.\u00a0 A contrived but \neffective\n gambit is the compliment\n\nsandwich: compliment, feedback, compliment.\u00a0 The only caveat is that you need to be genuine with the compliments (I\u2019m assuming the feedback is real).\u00a0 It\u2019s very unnatural but with practice I\u2019m told it becomes much easier (so says my wife who is great at it).\u00a0 The key here I think is still to work harder at understanding the person, that\u2019s what communicating is about in the end isn\u2019t it?\n\n\nHabits\n\n\nOne of the things that I\u2019ve learned is that good habits can go a \nlong\n way to getting to where you want to go.\u00a0 My current model is that most big accomplishments (e.g. learning a language, being an expert in a field etc.) are not a one time big effort but rather a bunch of small, \nconsistent\n steps\n in the right direction.\u00a0 Working at something day in and day out is pretty hard!\u00a0 It\u2019s a \ngrind\n sometimes.\u00a0 So habits make this process much easier.\u00a0 They\u2019re the default action you take, which means that you are much more likely to do them, automatically driving you in the right direction.\u00a0 Anyways, here are some good habits that I\u2019ve been picking up.\n\n\nBest Hour of the Day\n\n\nFollowing Charlie Munger\u2019s advice, I give the \nbest hour of the day\n to myself.\u00a0 Now that I have a more regular schedule going to bed at a normal time (thanks to my wife), I can wake up relatively early.\u00a0 At this time before I get ready for work, I work on my own projects.\u00a0 For the past couple of years, this has been my technical blog (see above).\u00a0 Of course, I don\u2019t do this \nevery\n day, sometimes I go to bed late and sleep in, other times I have early morning meetings but being a habit, it\u2019s my \ndefault\n behavior.\u00a0 Definitely something I want to keep up going forward.\n\n\nFilling in Downtime\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been learning Chinese and one my strategies is to use spaced repetition on a \nflashcard app\n on my phone.\u00a0 Every time I encounter a new word, I add it to the deck and everyday when I have some downtime (usually during breakfast or waiting for the subway) I work though the day\u2019s cards.\u00a0 It actually is not the most efficient way to learn because I\u2019m just casually going through the cards so I\u2019m not using 100% of my brain power.\u00a0 However, just by the fact that I\u2019m doing it nearly daily (and with spaced repetition), it helps over a long period of time.\u00a0 The most important part being a default behavior.\n\n\nIn a similar vein, I\u2019ve also been trying to practice singing during miscellaneous tasks.\u00a0 Now that I can tell (mostly) if I\u2019m singing something wrong, I practice singing while cleaning, showering, waiting for the elevator etc.\u00a0 It\u2019s not focused practice but similar to the flashcards, it definitely helps supplement the dedicated practice sessions.\u00a0 Just have more practice using my voice has been a big reason why I can progress with relatively few dedicated practice sessions (of course if I had more time I would want to have more dedicated practice sessions).\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nSadly this year I haven\u2019t spent much time reading books and actually two of the books in the list below I read over the Christmas break.\u00a0 Definitely something I want to change for next year.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a list of the books I read this year and some commentary.\n\n\n\n\nIntelligent Fanatics: How Great Leaders Build Sustainable Businesses (Ian Cassel and Sean Iddings)\n: Nice short book describing some great lesser-known business leaders (e.g. Les Schwab,\u00a0\nSimon Marks, John Patterson, Sol Price)\n and how they built their businesses.\u00a0 The book doesn\u2019t spend too much time on each leader and the story telling is a bit factual for my liking.\u00a0 It\u2019s an easy read and enjoyable but nothing too insightful.\n\n\nHow To Read A Book (Mortimer J. Adler)\n: This is a serious book!\u00a0 Originally published in 1940, it\u2019s about how to get the most out of reading by applying active reading strategies.\u00a0 I actually didn\u2019t finish the entire book, got through roughly 3/4 of it.\u00a0 But my main take away, that I\u2019ve started doing, is to always read with a pencil in my hand!\u00a0 Marking up books is a great way to help retain knowledge (even though it feels a bit wrong marking up a pretty book, definitely picked up during school when the teacher would scold me for this) and it allows you to go back and re-read the important parts that you missed.\u00a0 Many times in the past, I\u2019ve \npassively read something\n and not remembered it.\u00a0 Although that can be useful in its own way, wouldn\u2019t it be better if you remembered it?\u00a0 Anyways, if you want to pick up some strategies for reading, I\u2019d definitely recommend picking this book up.\n\n\nRational Optimist (Matt Ridley)\n: This book\u2019s thesis is very simple: despite all the terrible things going on in world today, it\u2019s getting better!\u00a0 He goes through a lot of history citing evidence of how things are getting better with the main idea that trade and specialization in human societies (so called \u201ccollective intelligence\u201d) is the reason why we have been rapidly advancing.\u00a0 And further the rapid advancements are the things that are solving humanity\u2019s problems (e.g. over population, global warming etc.).\u00a0 He urges us to continue trading and specializing and reject the idea that we must slow development down because the rapid pace of development is exactly what allowed us to solve the problems in the first place!\u00a0 It\u2019s a highly convincing book with a lot of historical evidence, definitely recommend it.\n\n\nHigh Output Management (Andrew S. Grove)\n: This is a book I just got before the break from my colleague.\u00a0 The author is the late and former CEO of Intel.\u00a0 It\u2019s probably one of the most useful management books that I\u2019ve read in a while because it\u2019s not just business book fluff.\u00a0 He actually goes into specific tactics that he has applied at Intel ranging from a model of how to think about your business \u201coutput\u201d, to specifics on how to conduct 1-on-1s and meetings, to what a manager\u2019s main duties are (\u201ctraining\u201d and \u201cmotivation\u201d).\u00a0 He peppers the book with lots of examples and specific situations.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great read for any manager.\u00a0 It\u2019s also short, so it\u2019s easy to go back and re-read certain sections (or look up the notes you made in the margin, thanks \u201cHow To Read A Book\u201d!).\n\n\nThe Tao of Charlie Munger (David Clark)\n: This book is just a bunch of quotes by Charlie Munger.\u00a0 It\u2019s not very useful and I wouldn\u2019t recommend it because if you\u2019re a fan of Charlie Munger you would have read all of these quotes, if you\u2019re not a fan, it\u2019s definitely not a good way to learn about him.\u00a0 I\u2019m just a sucker for Charlie, so I\u2019ll buy any book that might let me learn more about him.\n\n\nA Man for All Markets (Edward O. Thorp)\n: This is an autobiography by the great Ed Thorpe.\u00a0 He\u2019s not as well known as Claude Shannon but he\u2019s made a huge dent in the practical application of mathematics in the background.\u00a0 He\u2019s infamous for working out the math to beat blackjack, he also ran a statistical arbitrage hedge fund in the 70s/80s and independently (probably prior) discovered the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\u00a0 His returns at his fund were insane topping more than 20% annually for more than two decades, mind you with relatively little risk.\u00a0 The interesting part of his thinking is that he was never interested in the money in both cases, the problem is what he enjoyed.\u00a0 The application of the mathematics in both these domains were really just about experimenting to see if his math really worked.\u00a0 This is evidenced by him writing books, not long after he validated the ideas, describing in detail all his methods.\u00a0 He\u2019s incredibly interesting person, definitely genius caliber.\u00a0 It\u2019s also an easy read but you can tell his story telling is not as polished as some other biographers.\u00a0 This actually adds a bit of authenticity since he probably did write most of it himself.\u00a0 Definitely recommend!\n\n\nFearless Salary Negotiation: A Step-By-step Guide to Getting Paid What You\u2019re Worth (Josh Doody)\n: This is a book I saw recommended by \nPatrick McKenzie\n a while back, so I bought it and had the e-book sitting on my Kindle for a while.\u00a0 I decided to do a quick read of it over the break and I was pleasantly surprised.\u00a0 All the information is the book is kind of \u201cobvious\u201d but also incredibly useful.\u00a0 Salary negotiation is a hard topic because most employees will have only done it a handful of times while the HR people do it daily.\u00a0 The information in this book balances this information asymmetry giving details on how the whole thing works.\u00a0 It goes further to give you a step-by-step guide on how to approach the entire process, either negotiating a salary for a new job or trying to get a raise from an existing one.\u00a0 Definitely recommend, it\u2019s a short read and worth the probable increase to your salary by applying these techniques.\n\n\n\n\nThe Coming Year\n\n\n2018 is going to be a busy year for me.\u00a0 There\u2019s still a ton of work to do at Rubikloud, lots of things that I still want to learn in machine learning, and a few interesting side opportunities that might pop up for me as the year progresses.\u00a0 It\u2019s a bit daunting but also exciting.\u00a0 Here\u2019s to good fortune in 2018!\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\n2020 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2018/01/2017-year-in-review/"}
{"title": "Two Steps Forward, One Step Back", "content": "Two Steps Forward, One Step Back\n\t\t\nLearning is one of those funny things that we never \nlearn\n how to do \u2014 we just do it.\u00a0 As children, we somehow learn to read, do math, and play sports all without thinking too much about \nhow\n to learn or what it \nfeels\n like to learn.\u00a0 Learning is just a natural thing when you\u2019re growing up.\n\n\nAs a child, you\u2019re given lots of guidance, lots of opportunities and most importantly lots of time to learn.\u00a0 Contrast this with learning as an adult:\n\n\n\n\nYou rarely have explicit guidance \u2014 \nyou\u2019re an adult, teachers are for kids!\n\n\nYou have fewer opportunities to learn \u2014 \nyou\u2019re an adult, you\u2019re supposed to be able to identify and seize opportunities for yourself!\n\n\nYou have so much less time to learn \u2014 \nyou\u2019re an adult with a full schedule every day!\n\n\n\n\nWhich basically leads me to this fact: it\u2019s much harder to learn as an adult!\u00a0 As opposed to not being as capable to learn as an adult, which I think is a myth.\n\n\nMy situation was a bit different from most because I extended my schooling with graduate school.\u00a0 Although everyone there was still an adult, there was still a lot of guidance, (self-directed) opportunities, and most importantly time to learn.\u00a0 Now that I\u2019m working in the \u201creal world\u201d, I\u2019m finding myself bumping up against all of these challenges to learning as an adult.\n\n\nBut I digress, what I really wanted to talk about in this post was a phenomenon with learning that I have recently been thinking a lot about.\u00a0 It\u2019s the idea of \u201c\ntwo steps forward, one step back\n\u201d in learning.\u00a0 As you learn a new skill in a subject area, at times you feel like you\u2019re making good progress (\u201ctwo steps forward\u201d), but quickly realize you\u2019ve hit some kind of wall and your progress grinds to a halt (\u201cone step back\u201d).\u00a0 Incrementally you make progress but the process is grueling.\n\n\nWhen in school, I rarely thought about this process.\u00a0 You just keep moving forward, course after course, test after test.\u00a0 It\u2019s all such a whirlwind that you rarely have time to think about the actual process of learning.\u00a0 More importantly, since it\u2019s your full-time job to learn, this phenomenon may not be as apparent.\u00a0 However, when your full-time job is \nactually\n your full-time job, and learning is just a hobby, you start to think about it more.\n\n\nI most recently experienced this \u201ctwo steps forward, one step back\u201d phenomenon in three very different areas of learning:\n\n\n\n\nMachine Learning\n: I\u2019ve been trying to stay on top of (or catch up on?) all the recent developments in machine learning.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been pretty good at posting on my \ntechnical blog\n trying to explain concepts and ideas that I\u2019ve learned.\u00a0 Part of this process is really digging into the details of a particular topic including the math, the implementation and the intuition.\u00a0 But the more I dug into a topic, the more apparent it was that my knowledge of the area was relatively superficial.\u00a0 The math, the implementation, and even the concepts went so much deeper than I could have imagined.\u00a0 \nTwo steps forward, one step back.\n\n\nMusic\n: I\u2019ve been taking guitar lessons with an \namazing teacher\n for a while now, and recently just started vocal lessons with him too.\u00a0 When I started out I was pretty terrible, I mean \nreally\n terrible.\u00a0 I struggled with the most fundamental skill of simply \nknowing\n if I was matching pitch, never mind actually trying to match pitch.\u00a0 The analogy I like to use is that I was completely in the dark.\u00a0 As I progressed, I gradually got better at telling if I was on pitch and correspondingly matching pitch.\u00a0 I went from completely blind to having just really bad eye sight.\u00a0 However, as I was able to \u201csee\u201d more, the distance between two notes that initially felt so small, felt like they had much more space in between.\u00a0 But I soon after came the realization that there was yet another layer of detail that I was missing.\u00a0 \nTwo steps forward, one step back.\n\n\nChinese:\n I recently decided to take Mandarin lessons at a great \nChinese school\n in the evening after work.\u00a0 Part of my inspiration came from \nLee Kuan Yew\n, also of Chinese descent, who learned Mandarin in his thirties.\u00a0 So I thought: if one of the greatest minds of the last century could do it, why couldn\u2019t I?\u00a0 Obviously, it was a lot harder than I anticipated.\u00a0 One particular thing I was proud of early on, was how many Chinese characters I learned in a short period.\u00a0 There is this great little Chinese learning app called \nPlecko\n that has a flashcard program built-in.\u00a0 Every time I hear a new word, I add it to the program.\u00a0 At one point, I hit 1000 flashcard entries and it felt like a big achievement!\u00a0 The next lesson, I got put back in my place.\u00a0 I realized just how little I knew.\u00a0 In addition to a flurry of new vocabulary that I had never seen, there was a whole slew of new grammatical structures and phrases that were foreign to me.\u00a0\n Two steps forward, one step back.\n\n\n\n\nThis idea of making progress, but feel like you\u2019re not, is nothing new.\u00a0 It\u2019s part of learning, especially in a time-constrained way where you are bound to feel it more.\u00a0 As soon as I realized this pattern, I started to feel a bit better about it.\u00a0 Learning is rarely easy, there\u2019s always a grind, especially if you\u2019re trying to do it in a short period of time.\u00a0 Among the many quotes available, here\u2019s one by Confucius:\n\n\nReal knowledge is to know the extent of one\u2019s ignorance.\n\n\u2014 Confucius\n\n\nSo the fact that I feel like I\u2019m taking one step back is actually a sign of gaining more knowledge.\u00a0 Life is full of these little paradoxes.\u00a0 Now if someone would just \ntell me where I\u2019m going to die so I won\u2019t go there\n.\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2019 Year-In-Review\n2017 Year-In-Review\n2018 Year-In-Review\nShare

{"title": "Memorization and Learning", "content": "Memorization and Learning\n\t\t\nIt\u2019s funny how after so many years of being in school, there\u2019s always something new to learn \u2014 especially about learning.\u00a0 You would think that after more than 20 years of schooling somehow I would have learned every tip and trick, but nope, my ignorance seems to know no bounds.\u00a0 Recently I rediscovered a technique that has greatly improved my learning: memorization.\n\n\nMemorization and I have a very complicated history.\u00a0 When I was but a wee lad, I was frequently forced to learn things using memorization such as: Chinese, piano and of course, the usual memorization-laden subjects in school: history, geography, biology, etc. Even though I was not particularly adept at memorizing things, I will say that I got through these formative years with relatively high grades by having a lot of assiduity (as Charlie Munger likes to say \u201csitting on your ass until you do it\u201d) but these experiences left a sour taste in my mouth for memorization.\u00a0 The subjects I much greatly preferred required less rote memorization and more thinking (just my kind of problems!).\u00a0 Subjects like math, computers, English\u00a0\n1\n, physics and chemistry\n2\n were really my cup of tea.\u00a0 You just have to understand a single concept or technique and all of a sudden you can answer hundreds of questions, talk about efficiency!\u00a0 Of course, it still requires a lot of practice but it was a huge departure from trying to memorize a list of seemingly random facts.\n\n\nAs with many things in life, I feel like I\u2019ve come full circle.\u00a0 Recently, I\u2019ve started taking Chinese classes again as well as music lessons (mostly guitar, a bit of vocal).\u00a0 One thing that is crystal clear is that memorization is \nhugely\n beneficial\u2026 in certain contexts.\u00a0 For example, my Chinese speaking has always been lacking.\u00a0 I was a shy kid and didn\u2019t really make much of an effort to speak in Chinese.\u00a0 However by memorizing and reciting the textbook lessons, character by character, I\u2019ve been told my Chinese has improved quite a bit.\u00a0 There\u2019s something about actually moving your mouth, activating your vocal chords, and having sound come out that gets your neurons connecting properly.\u00a0 Another more obvious explanation: if I wanted to get better at speaking, I should practice speaking more!\u00a0 However, I will point out that the opportunities to memorize a piece of text and say it out loud are much more abundant than speaking to an actual human.\u00a0 In any case, a very useful application of memorization.\n\n\nThe other domain where I\u2019ve found memorization very useful is in music.\u00a0 When I was young, I thought music was about memorizing the correct order of notes to play.\u00a0 In my case, it was keys on a piano.\u00a0 I just had to figure out the right order and timing and I was done!\u00a0 Unfortunately, piano was not conducive to my learning style at the time and I quit after only a few months.\u00a0 However, while learning guitar as an adult, I realized that playing an instrument was so much more than just hitting the right notes.\u00a0 There are so many more abstract, higher level concepts like the subtleties of rhythm or the attack on the guitar.\u00a0 If you\u2019re still thinking about which note to play, you\u2019re definitely not thinking about these higher level concepts.\u00a0 Similarly, when trying to do two things at once, like singing and playing, there are so many things going on that you can\u2019t be thinking about all of them at once.\u00a0 Enter memorization.\u00a0 By memorizing the \u201ceasy\u201d parts, like the notes and lyrics, you can start focusing on the \nimportant\n parts of playing.\u00a0 In the case of a B.B. King solo, getting every little lick to sound just like the king, signature vibrato and all.\u00a0 Or when singing and playing, knowing the lyrics down pat, and playing the notes without thinking so you can concentrate on actually getting them to work together.\u00a0 Again, another important application of memorization.\n\n\nMy conclusion (which in hindsight is quite obvious) is that memorization has (at least) two important purposes.\u00a0 First, use memorization to physically enable you to learn something.\u00a0 That is, getting your muscle memory working and all the related neurons in your brain.\u00a0 For example, speaking a language, or playing a musical instrument.\u00a0 There\u2019s really no other way around learning these things except by rote practice \u2014 that\u2019s how our bodies work.\u00a0 Second, use memorization to be able to ignore the \u201ceasy\u201d parts so you can concentrate on higher level parts.\u00a0 For example, memorizing the lyrics to a song so you can focus on the actual singing, or memorizing the multiplication table so you can focus on algebra.\u00a0 In this application, memorization is a means to end to learn some higher level concept that is too difficult if you don\u2019t have the basics down.\n\n\nI\u2019m quite excited by my new (obvious) discovery on the usefulness of memorization.\u00a0 Although I probably should have come to this conclusion sooner, I\u2019m quite happy to be a little bit less ignorant.\u00a0 One of my goals in life is to be less ignorant, an ignorance removing machine if you will\n3\n.\u00a0 After all, you just have to be a bit better at ignorance removal and you won\u2019t get \neaten by a bear\n.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\n2017 Year-In-Review\nEssay writing requires coming up with a structured argument/flow.

{"title": "Consistency and Commitment", "content": "Consistency and Commitment\n\t\t\nIf you\u2019ve read my last post, a good model for human behavior is that of a \nmoist robot\n.\u00a0 We\u2019re nothing more than mere automatons (or automata) except that we\u2019re wet and squishy.\u00a0 This post is about another common behavior among us squishy automatons: consistency and commitment.\n\n\nInfluence\n by Cialdini describes this tendency in detail as one of the big six principles for how others manipulate our squishy brains into doing things that we otherwise wouldn\u2019t want to do.\u00a0 The funny thing about these psychological tendencies is that we\u2019re mostly blind to them \u2014 psychology researchers included!\u00a0 A recent blog \npost\n by Andrew Gelman discusses how scientific research in (certain parts of) the psychology community is quite lacking (particularly from a statistical point of view):\n\n\nThe short story is that Cuddy, Norton, and Fiske made a bunch of data errors\u2014which is too bad, but such things happen\u2014and then when the errors were pointed out to them, they refused to reconsider anything. Their substantive theory is so open-ended that it can explain just about any result, any interaction in any direction.\n\n\nThe interesting thing is that one of the main authors, Fiske, is a well-respected researcher in her field.\u00a0 Gelman is commenting about an open letter she sent criticizing social media and all the negative comments her research has received.\u00a0 She asserts that the comments should be done in a \u201cmoderated\u201d (read: research journal) where an editor can filter inappropriate comments.\u00a0 While in theory it sounds good, practically, these psychology researchers are falling for consistency and commitment fallacy.\u00a0 They believe that (implicitly) just because their research is published and they are well-respected then it has to be good (or at least not bad) even in the face of obvious errors, from Gelman\u2019s post (emphasis mine):\n\n\nShe\u2019s implicitly following what I\u2019ve sometimes called the research incumbency rule: that, once an article is published in some approved venue, it should be taken as truth. I\u2019ve written \nelsewhere\n on my problems with this attitude\u2014in short, (a) many published papers are clearly in error, which can often be seen just by internal examination of the claims and which becomes even clearer following unsuccessful replication, and (b) \npublication itself is such a crapshoot\n that it\u2019s a statistical error to draw a bright line between published and unpublished work.\n\n\nIronically from a psychological point of view, it all makes sense.\u00a0 If your worldview is different from reality, what\u2019s easier to believe: the nice rose-tinted glasses of your existing worldview or the unpleasant scent of \ncognitive dissonance\n?\u00a0 From Gelman\u2019s post:\n\n\nIf you\u2019d been deeply invested in the old system, it must be pretty upsetting to think about change. Fiske is in the position of someone who owns stock in a failing enterprise, so no wonder she wants to talk it up. The analogy\u2019s not perfect, though, because there\u2019s no one for her to sell her shares to. What Fiske should really do is cut her losses, admit that she and her colleagues were making a lot of mistakes, and move on. She\u2019s got tenure and she\u2019s got the keys to PPNAS, so she could do it. Short term, though, I guess it\u2019s a lot more comfortable for her to rant about replication terrorists and all that.\n\n\nFunny enough, this is not the only ironic situation that I\u2019ve come across.\u00a0 If you\u2019ve hung around enough programmers and data scientists, I won\u2019t have to tell you that they\u2019re (at least they say they are) all about \u201clogical reasoning\u201d and \u201crational thought\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0 But from what I\u2019ve seen, they\u2019re some of the most wet and squishy amongst us all.\u00a0 Just ask them what\u2019s wrong with X, where X is any of the most popular programming languages, just be ready to sit through a half an hour rant that is heavily rooted in opinion over facts.\n\n\nThere are worse things than highly opinionated people though.\u00a0 The worst case scenario is where consistency and commitment tendencies block the person from seeing their own mistakes, from Gelman\u2019s post:\n\n\nWe learn from our mistakes, but only if we recognize that they \nare\n mistakes. Debugging is a collaborative process. If you approve some code and I find a bug in it, I\u2019m not an adversary, I\u2019m a collaborator. If you try to paint me as an \u201cadversary\u201d in order to avoid having to correct the bug, that\u2019s \nyour\n problem.\n\n\nBeing open to collaborators who point out our flaws (hopefully in a congenial way) is really the first step in learning.\u00a0 Think about all the teachers you\u2019ve had, probably half of the learning comes from them pointing out mistakes (the other half from them teaching you a better way of solving the problem).\u00a0 Whether you\u2019re a toddler or a famous researcher, everyone needs help finding their mistakes, and more importantly everyone can learn from them.\u00a0 It\u2019s easier said than done though because, after all, we\u2019re just moist robots.\n\n\nRelated Posts:\nMoist Robots\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2016/10/consistency-and-commitment/"}
{"title": "Moist Robots", "content": "Moist Robots\n\t\t\nScott Adams has this really memorable term for how to think about people: \nmoist robots\n.\u00a0 Moist because \u2014 well, we\u2019re wet and squishy.\u00a0 Robots because there are certain predictable behaviors that we repeat.\u00a0 In situations like \nA\n, most people do \nf(A)\n.\u00a0 In situation; in situations like \nB\n, most people will do \nf(B)\n.\u00a0 Sounds very robot-like to me\n1\n.\n\n\nNow I\u2019m sure you can remember a time where this rings true, everyone has that friend who thinks their going to win big at the casino despite what hundreds of years of math suggest.\u00a0 This is great example of irrational behavior that has been programmed (in one way or another) into many of us \nmoist robots\n.\u00a0 Most of the time our squishy brains are great at detecting these problems but only when it\u2019s \nnot\n about us.\u00a0 It\u2019s easy to see your friend has no idea about probability, but much harder to see why you\u2019re such a sucker for Instagram.\n\n\nAs you read this sentence, you can imagine how this story can play out in any number of ways.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a very common story, you see someone who is super successful, perhaps someone famous you saw on the interweb.\u00a0 Naturally, you wonder how you can become super successful.\u00a0 Your parents will tell you that all you need is hard work.\u00a0 You\u2019re not so sure since they also told you that the Easter Bunny was real, so you also read Ms. Super Successful\u2019s biography.\u00a0 The book tells you it was her passion that drove her to eventually become CEO of company X.\u00a0 You\u2019re mostly convinced but to be sure you listen to her commencement speech and any interviews you can get a hold of, and they tell you the same thing: hard work and passion got Ms. Super Successful to where she is, and so can you\n2\n!\n\n\nBut let\u2019s not forget about one very important thing: we\u2019re all still \nmoist robots\n.\u00a0 A very common pattern (or \ncognitive bias\n as the psychologists call it) with \nmoist robots\n is that of \nself-serving bias\n: we have the tendency to perceive oneself in an overly favorable manner.\u00a0 So when Mrs. Super Successful is attributing her success to something, she overemphasizes the aspects that she has control over, namely: hard work and passion.\u00a0 Never mind the fact that her parents were in the 99th percentile of wealth, had connections with the trustees at an Ivy League school, and had an abundance of opportunities to learn the skills she needed to be successful \u2014 all she \nreally\n needed was hard work and passion.\u00a0 Which leads to another pattern called \nsurvivorship bias\n where us \nmoist robots\n mistakenly draw conclusions about what worked based on who survived (e.g. successful people) instead of the entire population (e.g. all people, successes and failures).\u00a0 If you looked at the people who worked hard and have passion, you would see a surprising number of \nmoist robots\n who weren\u2019t successful\n3\n.\n\n\nAnd so a successful \nmoist robot\n tells another young \nmoist robot\n, how to be successful and we see a predictable pattern of behavior again (you\u2019re a young \nmoist robot\n in this situation).\u00a0 You have multiple authority figures (parents, teachers, successful people) telling you to one thing (\nauthority bias\n), these people are generally very likable (\nliking bias\n), and you see that all successful people have worked hard and followed their passion (\nsuvivorship bias\n and \nbias from mere association\n), it\u2019s no wonder we\u2019re \nprogrammed\n to think that hard work and passion alone are enough to be successful.\u00a0 We\u2019re just \nmoist robots\n after all.\n\n\nHaving said all of that, I\u2019m still a big fan of working hard and following your passion.\u00a0 It\u2019s a pretty good \nprogram\n as far as us \nmoist robots\n go.\u00a0 I would add another crucial \nsubroutine\n though: luck (or more aptly randomness).\u00a0 Everything that happens is so dependent on our surrounding environment, which we rarely have control over, hence luck.\u00a0 If you\u2019re not factoring in luck then you\u2019re not factoring in reality.\u00a0 The trick is that your \nprogram\n should seek out and maximize the situations where luck is on your side and correspondingly move out of positions where it isn\u2019t.\u00a0 After all, what good is a (\nmoist\n) robot if you can\u2019t program it?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2017 Year-In-Review\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\nIf you want to learn more about moist robots, then you might be interested in getting Scott Adams\u2019 book:\u00a0\nHow to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life\n [\n\u21a9\n]\nPhrase intended, check out Stephen Colbert\u2019s \nbook\n [\n\u21a9\n]\nAlthough, you rarely see a successful person who doesn\u2019t work hard and have passion.\u00a0 It\u2019s kind of a necessary but not sufficient condition [\n\u21a9\n]\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2016/09/moist-robots/"}
{"title": "On Vaccines, Guns and Good Science", "content": "On Vaccines, Guns and Good Science\n\t\t\nAtul Gawande, the surgeon, writer, and public health expert (and author of a couple of my favorite books: \nThe Checklist Manifesto\n and \nBetter\n), delivered a \ncommencement speech\n to CalTech recently, here\u2019s an excerpt:\n\n\n\u201cThe scientific orientation has proved immensely powerful\u2026 But even where the knowledge provided by science is overwhelming, people often resist it\u2014sometimes outright deny it. Many people continue to believe, for instance, despite massive evidence to the contrary, that childhood vaccines cause autism (they do not); that people are safer owning a gun (they are not); that genetically modified crops are harmful (on balance, they have been beneficial); that climate change is not happening (it is).\u201d\n\n\nHe goes on to describe how pseudoscience \u201cexperts\u201d propagate these types of common sense misinformation while simultaneously dismissing scientifically established facts.\u00a0 If you haven\u2019t read the speech, I highly recommend it.\n\n\nBeyond what the speech has to say, I want to emphasize two important points about good science and good explanations.\u00a0 Science does not equal truth; it is incomplete, sometimes out right wrong, but that\u2019s a \nfeature\n not a bug.\u00a0 The big reason science works is because you can show that these hypotheses are wrong.\u00a0 Once you do, you can learn from it, and form a new hypothesis or model that describes the world a bit more accurately.\u00a0 The established scientific knowledge that we take as \u201cfacts\u201d have withstood every attempt we throw at it to prove it wrong; the ones that show cracks have either been discarded or corrected, what could be more rational?\u00a0 On the whole, science moves forward by explaining the world with increasingly more accurate approximations \u2014 never complete but always self-correcting.\u00a0 Contrast this to common sense and pseudoscience which never seem to move until contradictory scientific knowledge becomes so pervasive that it is forced to change.\n\n\nThe complementary point to this is about good explanations.\u00a0 It\u2019s natural for people to cling to their seemingly plausible pseudo-scientific beliefs even when faced with overwhelming evidence to the contrary (e.g. vaccines).\u00a0 Despite this overwhelming evidence that science provides, it is hard for someone to change their world view and part with their intuitive beliefs \u2014 it\u2019s not natural.\u00a0 The scientific community has recently been doing a poor job of explaining science to the masses.\u00a0 This is probably because many \u201cintellectuals\u201d find it necessary to attack the bad science instead of focusing on the good science.\u00a0 What these \u201cintellectuals\u201d forget is that attacking bad science is the same thing as attacking a person\u2019s world view \u2014 a very personal thing!\u00a0 It\u2019s no wonder that people don\u2019t respond well to it.\u00a0 Instead of rebutting bad science, a better approach is to explain the good science.\u00a0 For example, instead of berating someone for thinking vaccines cause autism, explain how they can save their child\u2019s life and the lives of many other children (who doesn\u2019t want to save children?).\u00a0 It\u2019s not enough to tell them their wrong (besides being ineffective), instead it\u2019s important to help them understand how the evidence is right.\u00a0 This is how things change, not with scientific discoveries but with people.\n\n\nIt\u2019s important for all of us to realize that rational thinking and cold hard facts aren\u2019t the end of an argument but rather its beginning.\u00a0 What comes after is what we scientists and intellectuals often forget: the human component.\u00a0 Ironically, it\u2019s all too human to think like this.\u00a0 So next time you\u2019re trying to educate someone on good science, don\u2019t forget that the most important part: good (human) explanations.\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\nBook Impressions -- 2019-Q2\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2016/06/on-vaccines-guns-and-good-science/"}

{"title": "Passion is Not Linear", "content": "Passion is Not Linear\n\t\t\nPassion\n1\n is one of those interesting human phenomena where we too often confuse cause for effect.\u00a0 The usual story about passion goes something like this:\n\n\n\n\nYou have a passion. Either you have had it all your life (presumably since you were in the womb), or perhaps you had a life changing experience where you all of a sudden developed a passion.\n\n\nYour passion leads to motivation, which allows you work and think about your passion night and day.\n\n\nOver time, you naturally learn more, become better than all the other soulless individuals without passion.\n\n\nYou now reap the rewards of following your passion.\n\n\n\n\nSounds like quite the motivational story, even if it\u2019s not true.\u00a0 The real flaw in this line of thinking is that it\u2019s linear \u2014 it\u2019s not.\u00a0 The process is not so simple that after step 1 is nicely wrapped up, you go onto step 2. Once step 2 is finished, proceed to step 3.\u00a0 With step 4 being the culmination of this grand process that you started when you decided to follow your passion.\u00a0 The only thing missing is to pass Go and collect $200 (maybe that\u2019s step 4 though?).\n\n\nLike most things dealing with humans, things are rarely so linear.\u00a0 Scott Adams has a great presentation on this idea titled \nPassion is Overrated and \nGoals are for Losers\n,\n quite the title.\u00a0 One of his main points is that:\n\n\n\u201cJust maybe [success] causes passion.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Scott Adams\n\n\nOf course it\u2019s a bit harder to think about how this might play out because steps 1-4 are no longer sequential.\u00a0 They\u2019re mixed up, twisted and intertwined.\u00a0 If we look at passion as a scale from 0 to 100, the process probably goes something like this:\n\n\n\n\nStart doing an activity (passion = 0)\n\n\nHave fun doing the activity (passion = 5)\n\n\nKeep doing the activity (passion = 6)\n\n\nGet praised for being good at the activity (passion = 10)\n\n\nTake a class on the activity (passion = 12)\n\n\nFigure out how much better other people are than you at activity (passion = 7)\n\n\nWork damn hard to improve your skills at activity (passion = 10)\n\n\nGet praised for how much progress you made from hard work (passion = 15)\n\n\nRepeat steps 5-8 until it becomes a full-fledged passion.\n\n\n\n\nNotice that step 1 is not suddenly knowing your passion.\u00a0 That\u2019s more like the last step.\u00a0 The first few steps take you from apathy to liking, then with some work (and success), perhaps from liking to liking a lot.\u00a0 Repeat that over many years.\u00a0 At some point along the way, if you\u2019ve worked hard enough and you\u2019ve had enough successes, you\u2019ve might end up with something most people call a passion.\u00a0 One of the most important points is that it\u2019s not all rainbows and unicorns.\u00a0 You can see in step 6 passion actually drops.\u00a0 This is probably more realistic.\u00a0 The people who actually develop passion have the discipline to persevere through the lulls and down moments.\u00a0 This is why you need both \ndiscipline\n and a \nsystem\n.\n\n\nPretty words and Hollywood movies have a way of making you believe that the world is a simple place.\u00a0 Passion is one of those nice simple ideas that is the panacea to all your woes.\u00a0 Unfortunately, things rarely are so clear-cut, they\u2019re usually much messier.\u00a0 That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to not get fooled into such simplistic thinking by thinking at the \nnext level\n.\n\n\nHaving said that, I\u2019m going to go watch the latest romantic comedy.\u00a0 It\u2019s supposed to be good because of the great acting and realistic portrayal of love\u2026\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2019 Year-In-Review\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2017 Year-In-Review\nI\u2019ve written about passion a few times (\nhere\n, \nhere\n and \nhere\n), so why not again?\n [\n\u21a9\n]\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2015/11/passion-is-not-linear/"}
{"title": "Motivation vs. Discipline", "content": "Motivation vs. Discipline\n\t\t\nAn interesting question, if you have to get a task done, which is more helpful motivation or discipline?\u00a0 An interesting \narticle\n titled \u201c\nScrew motivation, what you need is discipline\n\u201d contrasts the two:\n\n\n\u201cMotivation, broadly speaking, operates on the erroneous assumption that a particular mental or emotional\u00a0state is necessary to complete a task.\n\n\u2026\n\nDiscipline, by contrast, separates outwards functioning from moods and feelings \nand thereby ironically circumvents the problem by consistently improving them\n.\u201d\n\n\nClearly a not so subtle answer to the question but it hits on a really important point: people are generally lazy.\u00a0 A little explanation is required.\n\n\nA common misconception is that somehow what we feel and think drives what actions we take, a clear cut cause and effect.\u00a0 The reality (as often is the case) is quite a bit more complicated.\u00a0 Actually, our feelings and thoughts are much more intertwined with actions than our intuition lets on.\u00a0 Let\u2019s do a thought experiment.\n\n\nYou come home from work and are feeling a general malaise; if you were a colour, it would be grey; if you were the sky, it would be cloudy; if you were a word, it would be \u201cblah\u201d.\u00a0 Now, what would you do in this situation?\u00a0 Probably plop yourself on the couch, turn on the TV and zone out for the next few hours\n1\n.\u00a0 So clearly, feelings/thoughts caused you to do this drab activity, or did it?\u00a0 Let\u2019s look at an alternate reality.\n\n\nYou come home from work and are feeling a general malaise; if you were a colour, it would be grey; if you were the sky, it would be cloudy; if you were a word, it would be \u201cblah\u201d.\u00a0 As you are about to plop yourself on the couch, the alarm on your phone goes off reminding you that you\u2019re supposed to go do your 6 pm workout (4 times a week no less!).\u00a0 So you moan a bit and drag yourself to change and go for a run outside.\u00a0 After the run, how would you feel?\u00a0 Some words that I might use (depending on how the run went): tired, exhausted, energized, proud, happy, relieved, satisfied\u2026 the list goes on.\u00a0 In no case though would I imagine that we would use the word \u201cblah\u201d.\u00a0 Interesting isn\u2019t it?\u00a0 The action of running really caused our feelings (and most likely thoughts) to change.\u00a0 So the cause and effect of feelings and actions aren\u2019t so clear cut after all.\n\n\nNow circling back to the original question: motivation or discipline?\u00a0 Of course, we\u2019d prefer motivation.\u00a0 Motivation makes things easy.\u00a0 When we\u2019re really raring to hike up the mountain, it becomes (almost) fun.\u00a0 When we\u2019re determined to finish that assignment, it becomes effortless.\u00a0 When we\u2019re hungry to learn that new lick, practice seems like a breeze.\u00a0 We like motivation because we like things easy.\u00a0 The opposite is also true, we don\u2019t like things hard, which is just another way to say we are lazy\n2\n.\u00a0 But clearly the article is onto something that is obvious to everyone: we \ndon\u2019t\n always have motivation.\u00a0 Some tasks are hard, sometimes we can\u2019t see the finish line and we lose motivation.\u00a0 And this is the reason discipline is so important.\n\n\nDiscipline gives us a reason (along with \nhabits\n) to do some kind of action that we would normally not do left to our own devices.\u00a0 And here\u2019s the part that\u2019s unintuitive: discipline can affect \n*gasp* \nyour motivation.\u00a0 So then, discipline is a tool to help us get stuff done but also to help us gain motivation.\u00a0 It\u2019s easy to see examples all over the place such as when a kid does well on his math test because he did all his homework, it will encourage him to study more next time.\u00a0 Or perhaps practicing a guitar solo every day for a month, and then killing it at an impromptu performance for your friends.\u00a0 And we can\u2019t forget everyone\u2019s favorite activity of seeing the pounds on the scale go down through a consistent exercise regimen (and probably reduced calorie intake).\u00a0 Discipline can help us do more particularly through difficult tasks, and ironically make them easier (by giving us motivation).\n\n\nSo now then, motivation or discipline?\u00a0 Both of course!\u00a0 Not sure why there always needs to be a dichotomy between things.\u00a0 We should use the right tools for the right job, and both motivation and discipline are two powerful and complementary tools.\u00a0 Because you never want to be left with just one tool, as the old saying goes:\n\n\n\u201cTo a man with a hammer, every problem looks pretty much like a nail.\u201d\n\n\nI don\u2019t know about you but most of my problems are much too varied and delicate to use a hammer.\u00a0 Now a screwdriver on the other hand\u2026\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2022 Year-In-Review\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\nObviously dating myself a bit.\u00a0 How about something more modern?\u00a0 Plop yourself on the couch, open up YouTube on your iPad, and spend the next few hours watching videos of cats spinning in circles. [\n\u21a9\n]\nLaziness isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing.\u00a0 Sometimes great innovation comes out from being lazy (as a way to avoid doing things that are hard).\u00a0 Moreover, it\u2019s just a fact of human nature (and nature) that we try to minimize hard things.\u00a0 We don\u2019t lament our limited capacity to see the visible light spectrum, why attach negative connotations to our natural tendency to be lazy?

{"title": "Grandma\u2019s Rule", "content": "Grandma\u2019s Rule\n\t\t\nSome of the best minds in the world are working tirelessly, spending millions to determine how to motivate us to be more productive in our daily lives.\u00a0 I could\u2019ve saved them a lot of time and effort by just telling them about \nGrandma\u2019s Rule\n:\n\n\nGrandma\u2019s Rule is that you eat your vegetables if you want dessert.\n\n\nTo most parents, this is obvious; in fact, it\u2019s a common parenting technique that has been around for ages.\u00a0 Psychology researchers have even figured it out in the 70s and have called it \nPremack\u2019s Principle\n.\u00a0 It\u2019s simple and extremely effective.\n\n\nThe main idea of Grandma\u2019s Rule is that there are generally things you don\u2019t like doing but you know are good for you (e.g. eating veggies, exercising, doing your homework) as well as things you like doing (e.g. playing games, indulging in dessert, watching a movie).\u00a0 Left to our own devices, we tend to do what we like doing instead of things we don\u2019t like doing even though they\u2019re beneficial for us.\u00a0 Pretty obvious, right?\u00a0 The more difficult question is how do we get ourselves to do these less desirable but beneficial things.\u00a0 The answer is simple: Grandma\u2019s Rule.\u00a0 Only allow yourself to do the pleasurable activity once you have finished all the unpleasant but beneficial activities.\u00a0 It\u2019s a super power for productivity and it\u2019s easy to see why.\n\n\nEvery time you do unpleasant activities, you get rewarded with a desirable activity i.e. positive reinforcement.\u00a0 Over time, these unpleasant activities become less and less unpleasant because of the positive reinforcement of the reward, making them easier (and more likely) for you to do them.\u00a0 Moreover, the additional boost to productivity gives you more positive reinforcement because you\u2019re getting so much done, which encourages you to keep doing it and getting more done.\u00a0 In engineering terms, we call this a positive feedback loop.\n\n\nThere are probably only a few dozen really important ideas that can carry 80% of the freight in your life, and Grandma\u2019s Rule is definitely one of them.\u00a0 Before I finish off, I want to retell an anecdote that Charlie Munger mentioned in one of his \nspeeches\n.\u00a0 He tells us of a \nvery\n well paid psychologist who runs around America telling executives how to manipulate themselves to be more productive using not much more than a disciplined application of Grandma\u2019s Rule.\u00a0\u00a0 This psychologist basically tells the executive to organize their day so that what\u2019s unpleasant and important gets scheduled first and then reward themselves with something they really like doing afterwards.\u00a0 The executive see that it works marvels and with the obvious gain in productivity the psychologist gets paid very handsomely.\u00a0 Granny was a very wise woman.\n\n\nAn idea doesn\u2019t have to be complicated for it to be extremely effective.\u00a0 Granny\u2019s rule is definitely one of these super effective yet simple ideas\n1\n.\u00a0 Although truth be told, I am questioning a bit if it works all the time.\u00a0 I actually do like eating vegetables before dessert, so maybe it won\u2019t work for me in that case.\u00a0 Unless, it already has worked\u2026 \n*Mind Blown*\n.\u00a0 Granny was a very wise woman.\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2017 Year-In-Review\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\nAnother important one is the \ngolden rule\n, which has been around for at least a couple of millennia.\u00a0 It\u2019s clear that the idea of reciprocity is something that is tightly linked to human societies.

{"title": "Reading and Remembering", "content": "Reading and Remembering\n\t\t\nThere\u2019s something I need to admit: I read a lot and don\u2019t remember most of what I read!\u00a0 Thankfully, that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be.\u00a0 Let me elaborate.\n\n\nI\u2019m a huge fan of reading as a means to learning.\u00a0 There\u2019s so much knowledge that has been discovered by generations of the past that it\u2019s just not possible to learn everything through one\u2019s own experiences.\u00a0 Hence, learning vicariously through reading.\u00a0 I think most people intuitively agree with this basic premise.\u00a0 People who read quite a bit also know that they forget most of what they\u2019ve read!\u00a0 How can you possibly learn anything if you can\u2019t remember it in the first place?\n\n\nThe answer is quite simple: remembering is not the same thing as learning (despite what every educational institute you\u2019ve ever been to says).\u00a0 Remembering is what you do when you study for a test\n1\n.\u00a0 It involves mostly facts with the occasional brush with actual thinking.\u00a0 That probably sums up 95% of the tests you have ever taken, so it\u2019s natural to equate this fact-based drudgery with learning.\u00a0 However, remembering is such a small part of learning.\u00a0 Learning (at least how I define it) is about acquiring knowledge as to be \nuseful\n in some way, shape, or form.\u00a0 Decidedly not the same as rote memorization.\u00a0 Just ask anyone who has ever done any \nreal\n work.\u00a0 They\u2019ll tell you that they use \nmaybe\n 5% of what they have learned in school, and that\u2019s if they actually went to a good school\n2\n.\u00a0 So what then is the point of going to school \u2014 and by extension reading \u2014 if we don\u2019t remember or use what we have \u201clearned\u201d?\n\n\nThis has been a \nhuge\n question lingering in the back of my mind for quite some time (probably since I started reading on my own to learn).\u00a0 On the one hand, I knew in my gut that reading \u2014 regardless of how much I remembered \u2014 is incredibly useful.\u00a0 On the other hand, I just couldn\u2019t express exactly why.\u00a0 And then I read an essay by Paul Graham that really articulated what I knew intuitively:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cReading and experience train your model of the world. And even if you forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model of the world persists. Your mind is like a compiled program you\u2019ve lost the source of. It works, but you don\u2019t know why.\u201d\n\n\nHow You Know\n, Paul Graham\n\n\n\n\nReading is about training your mind on how to think \u2014 not on what it remembers\n3\n.\u00a0 It\u2019s the \u201clatticework of mental models\u201d that Charlie Munger is always espousing.\u00a0 Reading trains your brain to gain a greater depth and breadth of mental models to adapt to and solve the myriad of \nnon-trivial \nproblems you may encounter in the real world.\u00a0 And training is the right word here because it takes time for you mind to learn a mental model to the point where it\u2019s useful.\u00a0 Watching a TED talk on a subject doesn\u2019t mean learned anything useful; it just means that \nmight\n have remembered what the speaker said.\u00a0 Reading is different because it forces your brain to think about an idea multiple times over an extended period.\u00a0 Exactly what you need if you\u2019re trying to change how your brain thinks and approaches problems.\n\n\nBut maybe I\u2019m just being a grey beard here.\u00a0 Who\u2019s to say that that the new generation and they\u2019re fancy interwebs and social mediums aren\u2019t changing the way we learn for the better.\u00a0 I mean look at what it has brought us: \n140-char. tweets\n, \nfunny cat videos\n, and \ntinder\n.\u00a0 Who\u2019s to say this isn\u2019t raising the level of discourse and changing the way we think for the better?\n4\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2017 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\n2018 Year-In-Review\nFor \nmost\n tests anyways.\u00a0 A really good test will test you on how you think, not on what facts you know.\u00a0 The reason why most tests don\u2019t do this is because it\u2019s incredibly difficult.\u00a0 Trying to determine how well you think in only a couple of hours is quite a challenge. [\n\u21a9\n]\nGood in the sense that they made an effort to teach you things that will be useful to you later on \u2014 not necessarily in the traditional prestige sense. [\n\u21a9\n]\nAdmittedly, facts \nare\n important.\u00a0 For example, not remembering the multiplication table would make solving many different types of problems much more difficult.\u00a0 I\u2019m just trying to emphasize the point that it\u2019s just a very small part of actual learning.

{"title": "On Being Lost and Learning", "content": "On Being Lost and Learning\n\t\t\nThey say technology is making us smarter.\u00a0 I disagree.\u00a0 If you\u2019ve ever seen some idiot slowly driving into a lamppost because their eyes were glued to the GPS, you know what I am talking about.\u00a0 But it\u2019s not because of the minor accident that they\u2019re stupid, it\u2019s because they\u2019re not getting lost.\u00a0 Let me explain.\n\n\nOne of the big \u201cbenefits\u201d with technology is that we no longer have to \nthink\n.\u00a0 I mean, why would you every want to know how to do spell a word, do arithmetic, or learn how to navigate to the grocery store?\n1\n\u00a0 We have solutions for each one of them, they\u2019re called spell-check, calculators, and GPS.\u00a0 The fact that we have technologies to solve these problems doesn\u2019t automatically turn off our brains, it just has a tendency to do so.\u00a0 The natural tendency of the human brain is to use what\u2019s \neasily\n available, not what maximizes what we learn (which usually tends to be difficult).\u00a0 So for the prototypical GPS driver, not getting lost basically equates to not learning how to get there (without a GPS).\u00a0 If you\u2019ve ever been lost, I think you\u2019ll realize the universality of this logic: getting lost helps you learn to find your way.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s really interesting about this idea is not that it\u2019ll help you become a human navigator but rather how much this generalizes to other areas of learning.\u00a0 Getting lost is really a metaphor for making mistakes and figuring out \nwhy\n you made that mistake (\ni.e.\n learning).\u00a0 I contest that if you\u2019re not in position to make mistakes (e.g. a test, a competition, a peer-reviewed paper, a job) then you\u2019re not really going to learn much.\u00a0 This goes back to the theory of the lazy brain: it does what\u2019s easy (rightly so), not what\u2019s necessarily beneficial.\n\n\nOne of the big tricks that excellent researchers (read: people who are good at learning) know, either explicitly or implicitly, is that it\u2019s important to get lost \u2014 that\u2019s how you learn!\u00a0 A blog post I came across titled \u201c\nMathematicians are chronically lost and confused (and that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be)\n\u201d really resonated with me on this point.\u00a0 In the article, it mentions an excellent quote by Andrew Wiles (a renowned mathematician) about research:\n\n\nYou enter the first room of the mansion and it\u2019s completely dark. You stumble around bumping into the furniture but gradually you learn where each piece of furniture is. Finally, after six months or so, you find the light switch, you turn it on, and suddenly it\u2019s all illuminated. You can see exactly where you were. Then you move into the next room and spend another six months in the dark. So each of these breakthroughs, while sometimes they\u2019re momentary, sometimes over a period of a day or two, they are the culmination of, and couldn\u2019t exist without, the many months of stumbling around in the dark that precede them.\n\n\nThe author goes on to extend Andrew Wiles\u2019 analogy:\n\n\nWe all have to build up our insights over time, and it\u2019s an often slow and arduous process. In Andrew Wiles\u2019s analogy, my friend is still in the dark room, but she\u2019s feeling some object precisely enough to understand that it\u2019s a vase. She still has no idea where the light switch is, and the vase might give her no indication as to where to look next. But if piece by piece she can construct a clear enough picture of the room in her mind, then she will find the switch. What keeps her going is that she knows enough little insights will lead her to a breakthrough worth having.\n\n\nAlthough in the article the metaphor is directed more towards mathematics/research, it\u2019s equally applicable in other areas of learning.\u00a0 Learning to cook, play the guitar, or speaking another language, it\u2019s all about getting lost (and making mistakes), learning the pieces bit by bit and finally piecing together the bits into a flash of insight.\u00a0 It\u2019s slow, requires patience and necessitates hard work but that\u2019s what it takes for meaningful learning.\u00a0 \nAnd really that\u2019s the only way.\n\u00a0 N.B. I could be wrong here, I did just hear that there\u2019s an app for that\u2026\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2017 Year-In-Review\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\nI can think of some answers to this question, can you?

hand in that situation.\n\n\nAn investor aggressively loads up on leverage and goes bankrupt.\n\n\nHe\u2019s a\n c\nareless risk taker who never should have been using leverage in the first place.\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s important what kind of outcome you get (because what good is any of this if you get hit by a bus?), but what\u2019s also equally important is how you got that outcome.\u00a0 Given the information you had at that time, was that the best decision you could have made \u2014 even if events unfolded differently?\u00a0 It matters because most people aren\u2019t as lucky as the

opportunities that have come up time and time again in my life.\u00a0 Skill then, I suppose, is about making the most of those opportunities.\n\n\nSpeaking of which, there\u2019s an \nopportunity\n to

{"title": "Invert", "content": "Invert\n\t\t\n\u201cAll I want to know is where I\u2019m going to die so I\u2019ll never go there.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Charlie Munger\n\n\nThis is one of my favourite quotes from Charlie.\u00a0 It\u2019s apparently an \nold farmer\u2019s maxim\n and perfectly sums up one of Charlie\u2019s most beloved ideas for approaching life in a witty, paradoxical statement.\u00a0 Its spirit follows that of \nJacobi\n1\n who used to say \u201cInvert, always invert\u201d, a phrase Charlie often quotes.\u00a0 The big idea here is that hard problems should be looked at backwards in order to gain insight into the solution.\u00a0 If you\u2019ve ever tried solving one of these \npuzzles\n, you\u2019ll immediately recognize the benefit of this approach.\n\n\nThe genius of this approach is that it can be generalized to so many different situations.\u00a0 In Charlie\u2019s pithy quote, he sums up how to live a happy life.\u00a0 Working backwards: \u201cHow would I live a terrible life?\u201d\u00a0 Not too difficult to imagine that: drug addiction, sexually transmitted disease, tragic totally avoidable death/injury due to dangerous activities, I\u2019m sure you can think of some more big ones.\u00a0 So if you can avoid those things in life, you\u2019re on you way!\u00a0 Of course, there are many more things to avoid like unreliability, sloth, envy, greed, jealousy, lack of passion, lack of sleep etc.\u00a0 But this approach gives some new insight on how to lead your life: just avoid things that will make it terrible!\u00a0 Obvious when you put it like that but if you think about it, it\u2019s much more actionable than generic advice like \u201cthinking outside the box\u201d.\n\n\nHere\u2019s a related anecdote from my earlier days of being a student.\u00a0 When I was in high school and university, I was really good at taking tests \u2014 especially math based ones.\u00a0 I was diligent in following the typical advice of doing your homework and working through all the problems but I think one big distinguishing feature that got me \nreally\n high marks was using this idea of \u201cinverting\u201d.\u00a0 The thinking goes like this: \u201cHow would I do terribly on this test?\u201d\u00a0 Obviously not studying but more precisely by making mistakes.\u00a0 So I learned how to avoid making mistakes on the test.\u00a0 This one idea drove much of how I studied.\u00a0 I would work through a problem, find out what mistakes I made, mentally take note of it, and then re-work through the same problem until no more mistakes were made.\u00a0 And by \u201cmistakes\u201d I mean not just calculation errors but also misunderstandings and holes in concepts and ideas of how to approach the problem.\u00a0 The result was that when I was actually taking the test, it was much easier to get a really high mark simply because I had gone through all the ways I would have likely made mistakes\n2\n.\n\n\nThis general approach can be applied in so many various ways such as relationships, resumes, pot roasts, you name it.\u00a0 It can even be applied to writing.\u00a0 For example, the avoidance of using bad puns.\u00a0 Let me say once you start inverting, it\u2019s hard to stop.\u00a0 It\u2019s like reading a book about anti-gravity.

{"title": "Luck or Passion?", "content": "Luck or Passion?\n\t\t\nPreface\n: I wrote a post a while back titled: \nLucky or Smart?\n\u00a0 Along those same lines, I pose another question: Luck or Passion?\u00a0 (hint: luck wins every time.)\n\n\n\n\nA very common piece of advice that keeps coming up, over and over again, is \u201cfollow your passion\u201d\n1\n.\u00a0 While this advice is always well intentioned, and perhaps useful in certain circumstances, it may not be as \nuseful\n as the people giving the advice think.\u00a0 Scott Adams (creator of the Dilbert comic) has some interesting things to say about this:\n\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, it looks as if the projects that I was most passionate about were also the ones that worked. But objectively, \nmy passion level moved with my success\n. Success caused passion more than passion caused success.\u201d (emphasis mine)\n\n\u2013 Scott Adams, \nScott Adams\u2019 Secret of Success: Failure\n\n\nAn interesting idea.\u00a0 What if passion isn\u2019t something hidden inside of you but instead something that grows in you (presumably with success)?\u00a0 This might explain why all those super successful people you (and I) idolize are always going on and on about how you need to follow your passion.\u00a0 Easy for them!\u00a0 They were already super successful with what they were passionate about.\u00a0 Success feels good!\n\n\nSo let\u2019s stay with this train of thought.\u00a0 Success leads to passion, so what leads to success?\u00a0 Ay, there\u2019s the rub.\u00a0 No easy answer to that question\n2\n.\u00a0 Well\u2026 except for one: \nluck\n.\u00a0 But it\u2019s a bit more nuanced than that:\n\n\n\u201cI have a friend who is a gifted salesman [\u2026] His biggest problem in life is that he keeps trading his boat for a larger one, and that\u2019s a lot of work.\n\n\nObservers call him lucky. What I see is a man who accurately identified his skill set and chose a system that vastly increased his odds of getting \u201clucky.\u201d\n In fact, his system is so solid that it could withstand quite a bit of bad luck without buckling. \nHow much passion does this fellow have for his chosen field? Answer: zero.\n What he has is a spectacular system, and that beats passion every time.\u201d (emphasis mine)\n\n\u2013 Scott Adams, \nScott Adams\u2019 Secret of Success: Failure\n\n\nWhat Scott Adams is saying here is that you want a system that maximizes your luck.\u00a0 We know we can\u2019t control luck but we can control our situation\n3\n.\u00a0 In other words, developing a system where you\u2019re in more situations where success depends on a mere coin flip rather than the winning lottery ticket.\u00a0 Luck plays a big role in either situation but the system determines which situation you are in.\n\n\nThere usually aren\u2019t many easy answers in life except for one: luck wins every time.\u00a0 The secret is figuring out how to maximize luck.\u00a0 With that, I\u2019m feeling lucky.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s time to buy a lottery ticket\u2026\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2019 Year-In-Review\n2018 Year-In-Review\nPassion is Not Linear\nIn fact, I\u2019ve given this advice \nmany\n, \nmany\n times myself.

[\n\u21a9\n]\nThis is reminiscent of optimizing for expected value rather than a high payoff with a low probability of occurrence.\u00a0 Probability has more life applications than just learning how to gamble properly.

{"title": "We Are Mere Animals", "content": "We Are Mere Animals\n\t\t\nOne of the greatest fallacies that we\u2019ve been fooled into thinking is that we\u2019re so different from animals.\u00a0 Sure an animal can\u2019t drive (or \ncan it\n?), do long division, or understand the complex social interactions in \nKeeping Up with the Kardashians\n, but we\u2019re not as far from them as one might think.\u00a0 We still share many of the same characteristics of animals like eating, sleeping, mating, and socializing.\u00a0 We potty train our young just like we potty training our dogs, yet just because we have a higher level of reasoning we think we can ignore the same basic biological instincts that all animals (including us) share. \u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at at some examples of how our \u201chigher level\u201d of reasoning supposedly help us overcome our more basic instincts.\n\n\nMany people want to stay at a healthy weight\n1\n.\u00a0 What are the two ingredients we need to solve this problem?\u00a0 Easy, regular exercise and a balanced diet.\u00a0 How many people do you think follow this \u201cobvious\u201d solution?\u00a0 Probably a lot fewer than those who overeat and live a sedentary lifestyle.\u00a0 It\u2019s not easy for your brain to turn down a deliciously engineered fast food meal with a side of sugary soda pop\n2\n.\n\n\nHow about smoking?\u00a0 It has been clearly established that smoking can dramatically reduce your lifespan, cause lung cancer and a whole bag of other nasty things such as heart disease, infertility, and among other things nasty teeth.\u00a0 So you think those most informed would definitely swear it off?\u00a0 Yet, you can walk down to any major hospital and see a surprisingly high amount of doctors and nurses \u2014 professionals who treat patients for the deadly effects of smoking on a \ndaily\n basis \u2014 smoking outside the building.\u00a0 It\u2019s so easy to say you should quit smoking because it is bad for you and causes cancer but it\u2019s something every single smoker already knows (it\u2019s written on the label).\u00a0 Even for the most enlightened of thinkers, the biochemical processes of addiction are usually too strong to overcome.\n\n\nWhat it all comes down to is not that we have big brains, thus we are not animals.\u00a0 But more like we are animals\u00a0\nand \nhave big brains.\u00a0 Taleb put it eloquently in way that really struck a chord with me:\n\n\n\u201cOne of the most irritating conversations I\u2019ve had is with people who lecture me on \nhow I should \nbehave.\u00a0 Most of us know pretty much [know] \nhow we should\n behave.\u00a0 It is the execution that is the problem, not the absence of knowledge.\u00a0 I am tired of the moralizing slow-thinkers who pound me with platitudes like I should floss daily, eat my regular apple, and visit the gym outside of the New Year\u2019s resolution\u2026 We need \ntricks \nto get us there but before that we need to accept that fact that we are mere animals in need of lower forms of tricks, not lectures.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \nFooled By Randomness\n, Nassim Nicholas Taleb\n\n\nTaleb has the right idea here of how we can deal with our \u201canimal\u201d-selves: tricks.\u00a0 In other words, playing off our built-in biological and psychological tendencies to accomplish what we \nshould\n be doing.\u00a0 Understanding our natural tendencies can go a long way to overcoming many difficult problems \u2014 large and small \u2014 that we deal with in our lives.\u00a0 One example that stands out in my mind is weight watchers.\u00a0 Weight watchers doesn\u2019t use some fad diet to cause some sudden onset of weight loss.\u00a0 Instead, among other things, they act as a support group (i.e. a means to utilize \ninfluence tactics\n such as consistency and commitment, liking and social proof) to ensure that their members follow the common sense guidelines that we all know.\n\n\nSo know you all know what you \nshould\n be doing, whether or not you actually do it is another story.\u00a0 As for me, I\u2019d better finish this post off soon because I \nshould\n be cleaning up, doing laundry and washing the dishes today; translation: I\u2019m going to take a nap.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2021 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\nAs a side note, I just joined Twitter for a project at work and this type of problem is what is colloquially known as a \n#FirstWorldProblem\n.\u00a0 Funny enough, it seems that this hashtag is used primarily by teenagers who, by my estimation, have so little worldliness that it seems unlikely they understand the full depth of this phrase.

{"title": "Business", "content": "Business\n\t\t\n\u201cBusiness to me is the form and organization by which people creatively apply their skills and talents to solving problems or serving other people. The more a business serves others, and the more problems they solve, the more profitable they will be and the more an investor in those enterprises should make.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Tom Gayner, President and Chief Investment Officer, Markel Corporation\n\n\nWhen most people think about business, what\u2019s the first thing they think of? That\u2019s easy, money. You know\u2026 benjamins, mula, cash, coin, dough, dinero, cheddar, etc. And it\u2019s so easy to think this way because that\u2019s how business is portrayed in popular culture. Businesses think only about the money and making a buck. And while that\u2019s the easiest way to think about it \u2014 probably because it\u2019s quantifiable \u2014 it\u2019s not the most accurate.\n\n\nThere\u2019s a simpler, more fundamental way to look at them though: businesses solve problems and provide services. The quote above from Tom Gayner gives a very useful way to look at businesses \u2014 not in terms of money, of course \u2014 in terms of value. The value they bring when solving someone\u2019s problem; the value they bring when they service someone\u2019s need; and, yes, the value they bring for the investor who has allocated her capital with the company.\n\n\nBut money isn\u2019t really the central idea here \u2014 it\u2019s actually just the scorecard. How does a business really know if it\u2019s actually solving someone\u2019s problem or providing a valuable service? When someone\u2019s willing to pay for it. If more people are willing to pay for it, then the service is more valuable. It\u2019s a crude measure, yes, but quite effective in aggregate.\n\n\nThis idea that money is nothing but a (crude) scorecard is an important one. It works whether you\u2019re making money or just spending it. On the money making side, getting someone to pay you (like at your job) is really about trading your skills, talent and time for money. In other words, you provide value, you get paid. What a useful model to use when you want to get a raise. Want a $5,000 raise? Easy, just provide at least $5,000 (preferably more) in value. Want a $50,000 raise? Provide at least $50,000 more in value\u00a0\n1\n.\n\n\nOn the spending side, it\u2019s the reverse. For every dollar you let go, you had better be getting back (at least) a dollar in value. Now, of course, value is measured differently for everyone. That\u2019s why a $4 latte is both a great deal or a ripoff depending on who you ask. The important part is that the value it provides is greater than what you\u2019re paying. Remember this quote from Warren Buffett: \u201cPrice is what you pay, value is what you get.\u201d\n\n\nThis difference between value and money is probably the main reason why value is talked about so much less than money. Value isn\u2019t always quantifiable like money. It\u2019s not something you can plug into an equation. It\u2019s subjective by nature. And that means that you\u2019re going to have to figure out for yourself if something is valuable.\u00a0 It\u2019s not something your mom, your friend or even your professor can tell you.\u00a0 It\u2019s something you decide.\u00a0 Just like you\u2019ll have to decide the value of this post.\u00a0 All I can hope for is that the price is right.\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\n2017 Year-In-Review\n[1] Of course, it\u2019s not \nthat \neasy.

{"title": "Hypothesis Testing", "content": "Hypothesis Testing\n\t\t\nLately I\u2019ve been reading up a bit on what \nmanagement consultants\n do.\u00a0 Here are a group of people who go into Fortune 500 companies to advise senior management on how to deal with strategic or organizational issues \u2014 and get paid lots of money to do it.\u00a0 Judging how much money they make, they must be providing some level of strategic value.\u00a0 It turns out these consulting firms hire some of the best and brightest (think MBAs from Harvard), which is one reason why they provide value.\u00a0 But it turns out that just having smart people come in to tell you what to do isn\u2019t worth that much.\u00a0 In fact, that\u2019s only a small part of the value they provide.\u00a0 One of the most important things they do is help identify, analyze and recommend solutions for strategic problems primarily using time tested methods such as problem solving frameworks.\n\n\nThis idea of frameworks is incredibly powerful.\u00a0 One can imagine the diverse set of different problems that these consultants must encounter jumping from one industry (not just company) to another.\u00a0 Yet somehow they are still able to provide useful recommendations that their clients are happy with.\u00a0 This means that they must be doing something right.\u00a0 One important framework that I\u2019ve read about is this idea of \nhypothesis testing\n.\n\n\nNow this idea is not new; it\u2019s been around since the 17th century more commonly known (as least to scientists) as the \nscientific method\n.\u00a0 The concept is extremely simple: you do not want to bias your investigation with your own preconceptions, instead let reality speak for itself.\u00a0 Of course it\u2019s easier said than done, but here are the main points:\n\n\n\n\nFormulate Question\n: The question outlines the initial problem.\u00a0 It\u2019s important to ensure that the question effectively addresses the problem.\u00a0 Figuring out if you\u2019re asking the right questions is a whole different story though (and a separate post).\n\n\nHypothesis\n: An initial tentative answer based on known facts or experience (not just the first thing that pops into your mind).\u00a0 Sometimes it can be based on a hunch, but reflects your best understanding of the situation and reality.\u00a0 An important property of a hypothesis is that one is able to definitively support or reject them.\n\n\nPredictions (or assertions)\n: Based on your hypothesis a series of logical conclusions will follow.\u00a0 Here it\u2019s useful to systematically break down the hypothesis and assertions into what consultants refer to as \nMutually Exclusive and Completely Exhaustive (MECE) \nconditions.\u00a0 In other words, each statement in the hypothesis (and assertions) should not overlap or depend on each other, and they should sufficiently cover all aspects of the initial situation or problem.\u00a0 This aspect is important for consultants where the hypothesis needs to be credible.\n\n\nTesting (and analysis):\n This is where you determine if the hypothesis is true.\u00a0 Using known facts or experiments, see if any of the statements in the hypothesis or assertions are contradicted.\u00a0 If a convincing number of supporting statements or experiments match your initial hypothesis, it \nprobably\n represents reality fairly accurately.\u00a0 Otherwise, your hypothesis is false, which is equally important because it allows you to refine your model of reality (and go through the entire process again).\n\n\n\n\nNow everything that I\u2019ve written so far is probably not new to you (at least if you remember what you learned in science class).\u00a0 However, what I find fascinating about consultants is that they use this framework \nevery\n time they approach a problem (at least with regards to their client).\u00a0 This is an important because I think everyone knows that they should do hypothesis testing when running a science experiment, but what about when finding how much the market is willing to pay?\u00a0 Or whether a stock is any good to buy?\u00a0 Or whether you should even be following this advice?\n\n\nSimple ideas are powerful and can produce extraordinary results.\u00a0 And hypothesis testing is definitely simple and extremely powerful.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that we should all remember when trying to form a model of reality.\u00a0 To quote Charlie Munger:\n\n\n\u201c\nTake a simple idea and take it seriously.\n\u201c\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\nLucky or smart?\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2013/05/hypothesis-testing/"}
{"title": "Multi-Level Thinking", "content": "Multi-Level Thinking\n\t\t\nIn poker, there is a concept called \nleveling \nor \nmulti-level thinking\n.\u00a0 The basic idea is that you consider the consequences (and consequences of consequences, and consequences of consequences of consequences, and so on) of what your opponents are thinking.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the basic idea from a \npoker site\n:\n\n\n\n\nLevel 0: What do I have?\n\n\nLevel 1: What does my opponent have?\n\n\nLevel 2: What does my opponent think I have?\n\n\nLevel 3: What does my opponent think I think he has?\n\n\nLevel 4: What does my opponent think I think he thinks I have?\n\n\n\n\nOn one hand, Poker is an interesting game because there are so many concepts that resemble real-life problems such as probabilities, deceit and bluffing, betting, folding, equity, and I\u2019m sure numerous others.\u00a0 On the other hand, it is a greatly simplified compared to more realistic problems.\u00a0 For example, when do you ever know the exact probabilities of things?\u00a0 When do you have such strict rules for betting/folding?\u00a0 When can you be assured that the rules aren\u2019t every going to change?\u00a0 You get the idea.\n\n\nDespite all these simplifications, some of the \nideas\n can be transferable to real-world problems.\u00a0 And the one I mentioned above is a great example.\u00a0 Not employing multi-level thinking is a classic misjudgement when humans are confronted with complex systems (i.e. everything around us).\u00a0 Actions have consequences.\u00a0 Consequences have consequences.\u00a0 Consequences of consequences have consequences.\u00a0 You get the picture.\u00a0 Here is an example of this misjudgement applied to some fictional (and simplified) scenario that I read about in \nSeeking Wisdom: From Darwin to Munger\n by Peter Bevelin.\n\n\nRats have infested campus buildings and the university is implementing a solution whereby any student who turns in a dead rat receives $1.\n\n\nThis worked extremely well at first \u2014 until it didn\u2019t.\u00a0 Can you think of what could possibly go wrong with this scenario?\u00a0 Let\u2019s apply some multi-level thinking:\n\n\n\n\nLevel 0: Implement policy to remove rats by paying $1 for each dead rat.\n\n\nLevel 1: Students start killing rats, rats population shrinks.\n\n\nLevel 2: Poor students want more money, start breeding rats and not killing ones roaming around campus.\n\n\nLevel 3: University still has a rat problem, is out thousands of dollars, and now has rat farms all over campus.\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not always possible to consider every consequence of our actions, but with a few extra steps you can prevent some really stupid decisions.\n\n\nA product is about to be released to the market with little penetration.\u00a0 The company increases the price of the product and sales volume skyrocketed.\n\n\nThis scenario is from a \nspeech\n by Charlie Munger.\u00a0 This is a clear example where misguided thinking might lead you into the wrong direction.\u00a0 In this case, the consequence of the price increase isn\u2019t limited to the classic micro economic explanation (increase price, lower volume).\u00a0 The trick here is that even when thinking at Level 1, there are multiple possibilities.\u00a0 Why could the sales have suddenly increased when the price of the product rose?\u00a0 Higher price sometimes signals higher quality (e.g. luxury goods), leading to greater sales.\u00a0 My favourite answer though is Charlie\u2019s follow up, where he uses an idea from even higher level thinking: bribes.\u00a0 Use some of the extra margin you make on the product to give commission to the sales guy.\u00a0 He\u2019ll push the product more (since it makes more money from him) and at the same time making more money for you.\u00a0 This is a classic strategy used by Coca Cola and its distributors, as well as mutual funds and its sales reps.\n\n\nNow that I\u2019ve written about this, you might think that I\u2019ve thought about how you\u2019re going to perceive what I have written\u2026\u00a0 but you\u2019d be wrong.\u00a0 Instead, I\u2019m still stuck at level 0 trying to figure out what I\u2019m going to eat for lunch (and the consequences of it!)\n\n\nRelated Posts:\nRussian Roulette (or Luck Vs Skill)\n2018 Year-In-Review\nBook Impressions -- 2019-Q2\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2013/01/multi-level-thinking/"}

{"title": "A Slot Machine Riddle", "content": "A Slot Machine Riddle\n\t\t\nHere is a riddle I came across while reading a \nspeech\n by the wise Charlie Munger (transcribed by Whitney Tilson):\n\n\n\u201cYou own a small casino in Las Vegas. It has fifty standard slot machines. Identical in appearance, they\u2019re identical in the function. They have exactly the same payout ratios. The things that cause the payouts are exactly the same. They occur in the same percentages. But there\u2019s one machine in this group of slot machines that, no matter where you put it among the fifty, in fairly short order, when you go to the machines at the end of the day, there will be 25% more winnings from this one machine than from any other machine. Now surely I\u2019m not going to have a failure here. What is different about that heavy winning machine?\u201d\n\n\nNow before you read ahead for the answer \nthink\n about it.\u00a0 I sure did, and didn\u2019t really come up with a good solution.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a hint: it involves a psychological factor.\n\n\nGive up? Well, let\u2019s reason through it.\u00a0 If one slot machine in particular keeps making more money, more people must be playing it (and losing).\u00a0 But \nwhy\n are they playing it more?\u00a0 Well, since the machines look identical, it must be something involved with the slot machine game mechanics.\u00a0 But they are all paying out at the same rate.\u00a0 So what\u2019s left that could vary?\u00a0 The human factor.\u00a0 People are playing it more because everytime they lose, it\u2019s a near loss!\u00a0 Cherry\u2026 cherry\u2026 grapefruit.\u00a0 \u201cI almost won, I\u2019ve got to keep going!\u201d they\u2019ll say.\n\n\nThe point Charlie is making here is that there are several simple principles that make sense out of our irrational human tendencies, and going through life without understanding them is like \u201ca one legged man in an ass-kicking contest.\u201d\u00a0 Despite learning about logic and quantitative calculations, there\u2019s still much to learn about logically thinking about the illogical systems (i.e. human systems and interactions).\u00a0 And much of the difficult problems in life can be attributed to this one topic.\n\n\nAs for me, I think I\u2019ll be just fine so long as I can avoid landing on my butt too often.\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2017 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2012/12/a-slot-machine-riddle/"}

Whenever possible, spend money on \nexperiences\n such as taking your family to Disney World, rather than \nthings\n like a new television.\n\n\nBuy many small pleasures instead of few big ones.\n\nBecause we adapt so readily to change, the most effective use of your money is to bring frequent change, not just \u201cbig bang\u201d changes that you will quickly grow acclimated to. Break up large purchases, when possible, into smaller ones over time so that you can savor the entire experience. When it comes to happiness, frequency is more important than intensity. Embrace the idea that lots of small, pleasurable purchases are actually \nmore\n effective than a single giant one.\n\n\nThis is interesting because this is a bit counter-intuitive to how the conventional (consumer-driven) thinking about happiness goes.\u00a0 So a two-week vacation in Hawaii is better than a brand new Porsche, and a variety of less expensive meals is better than the super expensive French restaurant.\u00a0 Makes you think about whether that last big purchase was really worth it.\u00a0 All I know is that I\u2019m going to start spending my money where it makes me the most happy.\u00a0 Now where did I put that iPad\u2026\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2019 Year-In-Review\n2017 Year-In-Review\n2018 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2012/07/you-suck-at-happiness/"}

The poor can think of nothing else.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Oscar Wilde\n\n\nEver heard of the term \nrat-race\n? \nWikipedia\n defines it as \u201can endless, self-defeating or pointless pursuit.\u00a0 It conjures up the image of the futile efforts of a lab rat trying to escape while running around a maze or in a wheel.\u201d\u00a0 Sound familiar?\n\n\nI believe one of the biggest fallacies in building wealth is that a high paying salary is important.\u00a0 My argument for this is that in most developed countries (including mine), the highest marginal tax rate on salaried income is almost half your income (about \n48%\n in Ontario)!\u00a0 This means that even if you\u2019re working your butt off to make $500k/year, every extra dollar you make will only net you 50 cents.\u00a0 The rest is going to pay for our government services, healthcare, transportation etc. (Thanks rich people!)\u00a0 Another more theoretical point is that, it is almost never the case that you can grow your salary exponentially.\u00a0 You are typically paid in some proportion to the hours you work, and you only have so many hours.\u00a0 Despite this, for some strange reason there are (what seems like) an overwhelming number of very wealthy folks out there.\u00a0 How?\n\n\nWell this \narticle\n from \ninc.com\n has at least part of the answer.\u00a0 Here\u2019s how the top 400 income earners in 2009 made their money (in the US):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWages and salaries:\u00a0 8.6%\n\n\nInterest: 6.6%\n\n\nDividends: 13%\n\n\nPartnerships and corporations:\u00a0 19.9%\n\n\nCapital gains: 45.8%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis distribution is very telling.\u00a0 The salary/interest/dividend column is the smallest, while the bulk of their income came from businesses and capital gains.\u00a0 This should come as no surprise as the former category gets taxes heavily (at least in Canada), while the latter enjoys a much more favorable tax rate.\u00a0 It should also be no surprise that the former categories are the easiest ways to make money, while the latter ones are much more difficult or risky. So the conclusion is, want to get rich?\u00a0 Start a business or find an asset to invest in.\u00a0 How to do it?\u00a0 Ah, there\u2019s the rub.\u00a0 You\u2019ll have to figure that out on your own.\u00a0 If you\u2019re not up for it, I hear there\u2019s an opening for a position as a test subject; requirements: must like cheese.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRelated Posts:\nMulti-Level Thinking\nHow I'm re-learning Chinese\n2017 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2012/07/the-rich-getting-richer/"}
{"title": "PhD Grind", "content": "PhD Grind\n\t\t\nEver wonder what it\u2019s like to go through a PhD?\u00a0 Well, \nPhilip Guo\n has written an \namazing 122-page account\n of his experience doing a PhD in computer science at Stanford.\n\n\nDespite the story being about his personal experience, his PhD experience resonates (according to other comments on the internet) with many other technical and scientific fields.\u00a0 My experience was eerily similar to his as we\u2019re in very similar fields (computer engineering vs. computer science).\u00a0 It\u2019s quite funny how despite the wide variety of different things that PhDs around the world go through, there still are some commonalities.\n\n\nI highly recommend you read it.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a teaser:\n\n\nIf you are not going to become a professor, then why even bother pursuing a Ph.D.? This frequently-asked question is important because most Ph.D. graduates aren\u2019t able to get the same jobs as their university mentors and role models \u2014 tenure-track professors. There simply aren\u2019t enough available faculty positions, so most Ph.D. students are directly training for a job that they will never get. (Imagine how disconcerting it would be if medical or law school graduates couldn\u2019t get jobs as doctors or lawyers, respectively.)\n\n\nSo why would anyone spend six or more years doing a Ph.D. when they aren\u2019t going to become professors? Everyone has different motivations, but one possible answer is that a Ph.D. program provides a safe environment for certain types of people to push themselves far beyond their mental limits and then emerge stronger as a result. For example, my six years of Ph.D. training have made me wiser, savvier, grittier, and more steely, focused, creative, eloquent, perceptive, and professionally effective than I was as a fresh college graduate. (Two obvious caveats: Not every Ph.D. student received these benefits \u2014 many grew jaded and burned-out from their struggles. Also, lots of people cultivate these positive traits without going through a Ph.D. program.) Here is an imperfect analogy: Why would anyone spend years training to excel in a sport such as the Ironman Triathlon \u2014 a grueling race consisting of a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride, and a 26.2-mile run \u2014 when they aren\u2019t going to become professional athletes? In short, this experience pushes people far beyond their physical limits and enables them to emerge stronger as a result.

There is nothing the matter with this, except that it ain\u2019t so.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Mark Twain\n\n\nProfessor Damodarn has written up a \ngreat post\n about academia.\u00a0 He readily admits that academia is not the \u201ctruth seeking\u201d profession that is idealized in movies and television (and indeed in academia!).\u00a0 Instead, he gives six points about the realities of academia (which I must say that I broadly agree with after being around the block once or twice).\u00a0 I paraphrase here (for brevity):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch what will get you published, not necessarily what is interesting.\n\n\nBias is inherent in any human endeavor and drives not only the research direction, but also the how they experiments are setup and analyzed.\n\n\nBrand matters.\u00a0 Who you are, your school, your mentor, your research topic can significantly affect your chances of publication.\n\n\nEvery discipline has an \u201cestablished\u201d view.\u00a0 If you follow it, your paper will have an easier time being published.\u00a0 The inverse is also true.\n\n\nPeer review is widely variable and sometimes biased.\n\n\nData abuse happens.\n\n\n\n\nSounds pretty bleak, doesn\u2019t it?\u00a0 It\u2019s almost as if you shouldn\u2019t \nblindly\n trust any single paper that has come out of academia.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly what you should be doing!\u00a0 Sort of.\u00a0 Although he gives such a cynical outlook, he still strongly believes in peer review and empirical testing.\u00a0 And being the pragmatic, straight talking wise man that he is, Professor Damodaran also provides some advice for laymen:\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t assume that academics don\u2019t have an agenda and don\u2019t play politics. They do.\n\n\nDon\u2019t let \u201cresearch findings\u201d sway you too much \u2013 for every conclusive result in one direction, there is almost always just as conclusive a result in the opposite one.\n\n\nJust because something has been published does not make it the truth. Conversely, the failure to publish does not mean that a paper is unworthy.\n\n\nDevelop your own vision of the world before you start reading papers in an area. Take what you find to be interesting and provocative and abandon the fluff (and there is plenty in the typical published paper).\n\n\nLearn statistics. It is amazing how much of what you see reported as the truth fails the \u201cstandard error\u201d test.\n\n\n\n\nAll sage advice.\u00a0 One important point in defense of academics though is that \nmost\n work is incremental.\u00a0 Break-throughs don\u2019t happen that often, especially not every publication.\u00a0 I suspect that almost every \u201cbreak-through\u201d we read about in the news is only one step in a promising new direction.\u00a0 And only that \u2014 a step.\u00a0 No one paper is going to have the exact cure for Alzheimer\u2019s disease or produce cold fusion.\u00a0 Most likely the results will have to be reproduced, built upon and engineered (I couldn\u2019t leave this part out) before we realize the impact and value of the publication.\u00a0 And that\u2019s the beauty of it.\u00a0 Millions of researchers are taking millions of steps in different directions trying to expand human knowledge.\u00a0 Most of it will be insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but a few will change the world forever.\u00a0 And of course along the way, there will always be people who cheat, as well as people who do great work, but (scientific) progress is made.\u00a0 Instead of being cynical I like to think about it more like the Carpenters: \u201cwe\u2019ve only just begun\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\n2022 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2012/06/academia-and-research/"}

{"title": "The Milgram Experiment", "content": "The Milgram Experiment\n\t\t\nSometime in the summer of 1963 in a small town somewhere in New England, a young man named John stepped into an empty room to find a tall dark middle aged man in a white lab coat holding a clipboard. The man introduced himself as Dr. Milgram, momentarily stepped out and came back with a chair, a single sheet of paper, and a little box with a dial on it. John was told that we would be participating in a revolutionary new method of teaching that could lead to a golden age in American education. His job was to learn how to apply the method properly to see if it could be replicated across all American schools. \n1\n \n\n\nDr. Milgram proceeded to attach two electrodes to the John\u2019s chest, turned the dial on the little box to \u201c50V\u201d and pushed a red button on the box. He felt an immediate, slightly painful, shock. Dr. Milgram then called in another young man who would be the student. John\u2019s job was to teach this student every pair of words on this list. He would read one out, then the student would respond. If the student did not respond correctly, he would turn the dial up by 50V and press the red button. If the student did respond correctly, he would continue on to the next word in the list. The student then walked into the other room where he could be heard but not seen. \n\n\nJohn felt a bit apprehensive about this whole situation but Dr. Milgram reassured him that this was safe. So he began with the first word on the list. The student from the next room answered incorrectly. John pressed the red button and the student made a sound that was barely audible. He turned the dial up 50V and proceeded to the next word on the list. The student again responded incorrectly so he pressed pressed the red button again. This time the student could clearly be heard from the next room. John pressed on. Turn up 50V and ask another word. This time the student got it right, John was relieved but that soon faded as the student from the next room cried out in pain from his incorrect answer. \n\n\nAt this point John knew something was wrong. He asked Dr. Milgram if we should check on the student, but Dr. Milgram assured him that the student was fine and said that: \u201cThe experiment requires that you continue.\u201d John kept listing words and kept turning up the dials. Next 200V, then 250V. Dr. Milgram insisted that the experiment go on. \u201cIt is absolutely essential that you continue,\u201d he said. 300V, 350V. \u201cYou have no other choice, you must go on,\u201d pressed the doctor. Finally, he got to the last word which was incorrectly answered and 450V was applied. The student in the other room cried out in agony and quietly wept afterwards. Dr. Milgram thanked him for his time and showed him the way out. \n\n\nFor years after that incident John would be able to hear the cries of pain coming from that poor student. What had he done? How could he have inflicted so much pain on another person? Why did he listen to Dr. Milgram? Why did he do those terrible things?\u00a0 Those were questions that alluded him for the rest of his days. \n2\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2020 Year-In-Review\nBook Impressions -- 2019-Q4\n[1] Although the story is fictional, this \nexperiment\n was actually performed to see the effect that authority can have on an individual.

One great way to get around that is to find opposing opinions by intelligent folks on whatever subject you might get blinded by and I was going to refer to a \nrecent post\n by Professor Damodarn titled \u201cThe Buffett Plan: An apt name for a sanctimonious, hypocritical and superficial proposal.\u201d  I still might write something on this so look out.

how Sebastian Thrun\u2019s \nUdacity\n is going to change how higher eduction works.\u00a0 His points in the article were that there were three key failures in the current model for higher education:\n\n\n\n\nFailure #1: Exclusivity\n\n\nFailure #2: Grades\n\n\nFailure #3: Lectures\n\n\n\n\nMuch of the discussion was talking about how Udacity might correct some of these failures and usurp the traditional forms of higher education.\u00a0 I respectfully disagree \u2014 at least not according to the arguments stated.\u00a0 One key aspect is missing from this model that the current model of higher education does really well: playing to incentives of the stakeholders.\u00a0 Let me address the three points individually.\n\n\nGrades\n\nThe biggest presupposition they make with any of these new models for higher education is that most students want to go to school to learn.\u00a0 This is a commendable idealism but couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\u00a0 I strongly suspect that the main motivation of students is to get a good job (high paying, growth opportunities, good location etc.).\u00a0 If this is the incentive, then we should consider what is in the best interest of companies looking to hire graduates of these institutions.\u00a0 Ideally, they want to hire the best candidate with a high degree of confidence.\u00a0 Obviously this is not a simple task.\u00a0 This requires evaluating each candidate for using strict hiring guidelines and processes.\u00a0 This just doesn\u2019t scale well when a single job may have hundreds of applicants.\u00a0 Practically, employers need some \neasy\n measure to filter out candidates.\u00a0 Yes, they might miss the diamond in the rough, but they save that time in hours and hours of filtering out poor candidates.\u00a0 Enter grades.\u00a0 Reducing your entire education to a single number or letter average may seem disheartening to the poor student who has toiled to achieve a respectable degree, but it\u2019s dead easy to filter out people.\u00a0 Below B+, out.\u00a0 A+, interview immediately.\u00a0 Everyone else in between, look at their resumes.\u00a0 Like it or not, the purpose of grades is exactly to reduce your talent, ingenuity and performance to a single number so that you can be binned.\u00a0 It\u2019s obviously not accurate, nor precise, not to mention rife with abuse, but it\u2019s the trade-off for how easy it is to use.\n\n\nExclusivity\n\nLike any fashion retailer knows, your brand is one of the most important assets when you are trying to sell a high end product.\u00a0 The same goes for a person, a company or a school.\u00a0 If you brand gets diluted, its value (deserved or not) goes down.\u00a0 This is precisely why many schools are exclusive.\u00a0 If MIT suddenly accepted ten times the amount of engineering students, how would the quality of their out-going students fare?\u00a0 My bet is that the average performance would greatly decrease.\u00a0 This causes a huge negative effect on the brand that, in the end, does the school, alumni and graduating students a disservice.\u00a0 It\u2019s like if we produced ten times the amount of diamonds, that 1 karat ring that you got your wife all of a sudden doesn\u2019t mean the same thing (although it\u2019s great for people looking to pick up a diamond).\u00a0 Brand \u2014 and maintaining it \u2014 is an important factor that drives the incentives of everyone already affiliated with the university. \u00a0This means that for the most part, all these existing parties will want exclusivity over a diluted brand.\n\n\nLectures\n\nAs for the final failure of universities, I think the original article is spot on.\u00a0 Lectures are a very limited way to convey information, but it\u2019s still not clear if there is a scalable model(s) that works as well.\u00a0 Giving an iPad to all students definitely is not the solution.\u00a0 Some universities are already providing video taped lectures for students to view online but this is not the end all or be all of learning.\u00a0 Most likely different types of material work best when taught in different ways.\u00a0 I believe that this is an evolution that will (albeit slowly) incorporate newer technologies.\u00a0 Lectures are mostly just an older model that scales well and does a decent job.\u00a0 Newer methods are welcome and hopefully we can see some great innovation here.\n\n\nIncentives, incentives, incentives\u2026\n\nCharlie Munger is one of my heroes, in part, because he has some much wisdom without any of the BS.\u00a0 He\u2019s a huge advocate of \nincentives\n and you should be too.\u00a0 Most people talk about what \nshould\n happen instead of what \nwill\n happen.\u00a0 It\u2019s unfortunate that we don\u2019t live in an ideal world, but that\u2019s the reality.\u00a0 The only way to make things change for the better is if we make policies, models, and rules that play off the natural human instinct to be swayed by incentives.\u00a0 Of course, \nI haven\u2019t talked about\n any solutions, I\u2019m not sure I have any.\u00a0 I\u2019m just reminding you that regardless of whatever innovations, ideas, or ideology you have, none of it is going to have any relevance without somehow working incentives into the picture.\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2021 Year-In-Review\nBook Impressions --

{"title": "Incentives and Marks", "content": "Incentives and Marks\n\t\t\nIncentives\n can be powerful things especially for the worse.\u00a0 Here\u2019s one professor\u2019s story on \nwhy he\u2019s not a professor anymore\n.\u00a0 A particularly interesting excerpt is on the subject of \u201cscaling\u201d marks:\n\n\n\u201cHowever there are lots of ways round this little problem. One of them is doctoring the marks.\u00a0 Except its not called \u2018doctoring\u2019 its called \u2018scaling\u2019 and its done by computer. You scale the marks until you get the nice binomial distribution of fails and firsts. You can turn a fail into a II(ii) with scaling. Probably you want to be generous because otherwise students might not elect to study your course next year and then your course will be shut down and you\u2019ll be teaching Word for Windows. Scaling was universal and nobody except the external auditors (who were lecturers who did the same thing themselves) got to see anything but the scaled marks.\u201d\n\n\nOne way to look at it is to view the system abstractly as an optimization problem.\u00a0 If you have 10,000 undergraduate students per year trying to optimize their marks, all of which are funding (at least in part) the pay of the university and the professor in question, which goal is going to be optimized first?\u00a0 One professor who wishes to maintain the high quality of standard, or the 10,000 (per year) undergraduates all trying to maximize marks while minimizing work?\u00a0 Gone are the days when I think of university as a place solely for higher learning.\u00a0 (Though it\u2019s important not to draw broad strokes on the few who still are fighting the good fight.)\n\n\nKnowing this, it\u2019s almost crazy to think that one person can change such entrenched institutions as universities.\u00a0 But perhaps that\u2019s exactly what we need more of \u2014 crazy people:\n\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes\u2026 the ones who see things differently \u2014 they\u2019re not fond of rules\u2026 You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can\u2019t do is ignore them because they change things\u2026 they push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.\u201d\n\nThink Different, narrated by Steve Jobs\n\n\nSo go on, get your crazy on today.\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\nBook Impressions -- 2019-Q4\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2012/01/incentives-and-marks/"}

{"title": "Learn by Doing", "content": "Learn by Doing\n\t\t\nThere are dozens of articles about learn by doing or experiencing or taking action or any number of synonyms.\u00a0 This is as opposed to learn by reading, listening, planning etc.\u00a0 The basic gist of this idea is that there are some ideas that can\u2019t be learned by reading a book, they can only be learned by actually doing the activity.\u00a0 I think most people generally agree but I\u2019d like to offer up some of my experience and a caveat I\u2019ve observed.\n\n\nIn graduate school, I\u2019m a teaching assistant for a course called Algorithms and Data Structures that offers both a undergraduate version and a graduate one.\u00a0 The undergraduate version is pretty vanilla with reasonable level questions that some students intuitively get but others struggle with; the usual spread between any reasonably difficult undergraduate coarse.\u00a0 But the graduate version is much more insidious.\u00a0 The professor purposely puts questions on the homework (and to some extent on the exam) that are not just hard but tortuous.\u00a0 These are the kinds of questions that you can literally spend hours thinking about only to end up in the exact same place you started in.\u00a0 It\u2019s like a maze involving sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, max flow and any other nasty \u201cbasic\u201d algorithms you can think of.\n\n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that the students complain.\u00a0 They wish it could be easier and sometimes a few ask for help on how to make it easier.\u00a0 I answer them but I\u2019m sad to say it\u2019s never the answer they want to hear.\u00a0 The answer I give them is that you really have to learn by doing.\u00a0 That is, you only get good at these algorithm questions after you\u2019ve done a lot of them.\u00a0 That\u2019s the way you build intuition, by doing \u2014 NOT by someone more experienced than you telling you all the answers.\u00a0 It\u2019s always tough to hear because I know they are stressed out with three or four other courses all with their own deadlines and of course they\u2019re worried about their marks (even though the latter isn\u2019t so important in graduate school).\u00a0 And alas (I hope) they realize that there is no shortcut, sometimes you have to cross through the bush to get to the other side.\n\n\nAnd here\u2019s where my caveat comes in: the one thing that seems to be missed when touting the \u201clearn-by-doing\u201d strategy is that it can be \nreally hard\n.\u00a0 Either because it\u2019s really scary (e.g. public speaking), or maybe just a lot of work (e.g. algorithms).\u00a0 The best teachers I know intuitively understand this and make you take that key step in understanding by yourself.\u00a0 It may be hard but no one said learning was easy.\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\n2017 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2011/12/learn-by-doing/"}

(this one is 101)\n\n\nIt\u2019s funny initially I tried writing mini-essays, something similar to Paul Graham.\u00a0 Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t keep up with it (also they weren\u2019t nearly as good).\u00a0 The task of writing a 500 word piece was so daunting that I wasn\u2019t motivated to keep up.\u00a0 So I stopped for a while.\u00a0 After a brief hiatus, I realized why limit myself to 500 words?\u00a0 So I decided to set a goal of 4-6 posts a month regardless of the length.

(Although, people can still comment on Facebook).\n\n\nWhen I co-posted with Facebook, my readership skyrocketed (from almost nothing to still a very low number).\u00a0 Surprise, surprise, turns out most people get their information through Facebook.\n\n\nThere\u2019s a real sense of accomplishment when I look back at all the \u201cwork\u201d I\u2019ve done.\u00a0 Even reading some of my previous posts, I\u2019m pretty happy and surprised at how good they are.\u00a0 Unfortunately, this definitely doesn\u2019t apply to all of them.\n\n\n\n\nWhat good is knowledge if you can\u2019t share it?\u00a0 I\u2019ll keep sharing and hopefully someone will keep reading.\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2017 Year-In-Review\n2020 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2011/06/little-by-little/"}

{"title": "Culture", "content": "Culture\n\t\t\nAs a previous post mentioned, I recently visited Japan and noticed\u00a0 what most people notice when they go to Japan:\u00a0 it\u2019s an incredibly clean place, even by Canadian standards.\u00a0 And the strange part is that there are almost no garbage cans to be found.\u00a0 That\u2019s probably where most people stop thinking about it.\u00a0 But one should wonder how they can possibly keep the place so clean with the total lack of garbage cans.\u00a0 That answer I came to is simpler than you may think.\n\n\nFirstly, they do not have armies of people picking up trash.\u00a0 I would estimate they probably have as many people picking up trash as we do in Canada.\u00a0 So that doesn\u2019t explain the large difference in cleanliness.\u00a0 Second, one might come to the incorrect conclusion that they have significantly less trash than us living in North America.\u00a0 This is far from the truth.\u00a0 In fact, I would argue that they have even more waste than us.\u00a0 Take a simple chocolate bar for example.\u00a0 In Canada, we may have one box containing many pieces of little chocolates.\u00a0 Sounds reasonable.\u00a0 In Japan, they still have the one box but it contains individually wrapped pieces of chocolates wrapped up in an appealing foil exterior.\u00a0 On top of that, they have another transparent plastic wrap for the entire box adding to the amount of packaging.\u00a0 Sounds like more waste to me.\u00a0 So it seems that having less garbage definitely is not a contributor to their cleanliness.\u00a0 So what could possibly be the reason?\u00a0 The answer to that is simple: culture.\n\n\nJapanese people (in general) do not litter.\u00a0 Even when it inconveniences them, they still do not.\u00a0 For example, had they bought that same chocolate bar and wanted to throw away the excess packaging, they would carry around the garbage until they reached their home to throw it away.\u00a0 This may not be too surprising because I know I do that sometimes even in Canada.\u00a0 However, Japanese people take it to an extreme.\u00a0 Even for cigarettes, they do not litter.\u00a0 They have a special little bag to carry around their \nused \ncigarettes so they can dispose of it at home.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know anybody in Canada who would even consider doing this.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve also heard anecdotally, that after outdoor concerts in a public place, there is no need for cleanup.\u00a0 It\u2019s just clean because no one litters.\u00a0 Amazing!\n\n\nThe paradoxical point about this phenomenon is that even though it\u2019s incredibly inconvenient to do, they still do it.\u00a0 They\u2019re not forced to hold on to their garbage; they don\u2019t really get any individual benefit from doing so; they just do it.\u00a0 Culture is a powerful force that can lead to many amazing, non-obvious results.\u00a0 And it\u2019s easy to see it in full effect in Japan because how else can you keep a country with 100 million people clean so cheaply?\u00a0 Culture is the only way I know how.\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2021 Year-In-Review\nGarbage In\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2011/03/culture/"}

{"title": "A Surprising Thing About Graduate School", "content": "A Surprising Thing About Graduate School\n\t\t\nBefore I came to graduate school, I had this grand picture.\u00a0 Here was an institute dedicated to the advancement of science and knowledge.\u00a0 Researchers fervently working on the fringe of human knowledge in their particular subject matter.\u00a0 Every topic somehow contributing to this grand scheme called human progress.\n\n\nIt\u2019s funny how we like to idealize things that we know nothing about.\n\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong though, there are tons of smart people working on tons of really interesting and important problems.\u00a0 But there is definitely one thing I did not expect when I came to graduate school: the enormous amount of writing I would have to do (at least from the point of view of an engineering undergraduate).\n\n\nOne of the primary reasons why I came to graduate school is to work on interesting problems.\u00a0 And I get to do that on every research project I work on.\u00a0 The only thing I didn\u2019t really think about is what happens after I come up with and implement a solution to that problem.\u00a0 The answer (which in hindsight I should have thought about) is that you have to share it; communicate it; or in other words, write it out in a painstakingly clear prose so that semi-experts can understand it (and think it\u2019s useful).\u00a0 It turns out the last part is a necessary condition to be a good researcher (it\u2019s obvious if you think about it).\u00a0 So what does this fact have to do with me and graduate school?\u00a0 It means I have to write a lot \u2014 something that most new graduates don\u2019t think about.\n\n\nCome to think of it though, maybe it\u2019s best  that young budding minds excited about doing new and innovative research don\u2019t get told about this.\u00a0 I mean, what would happen if grad. school\u2019s tag line was: \u201cResearch: it\u2019s about communication, stupid!\u201d\u00a0 It turns out though, writing (and communication in general) is very important to your overall success.\u00a0 In fact, it may be even more useful to your individual success than your actual research project!\u00a0 So while most don\u2019t like writing, the end result of writing paper after paper is that you get good at it.\u00a0 And even start to like it a bit.\n\n\nSo while I still grumble at the thought of having to write yet another paper, I guess I\u2019m always working on some challenging problem whether that be the actual research, or figuring out how to present it effectively.\u00a0 In the end, grad. school is close to what I thought it would be: working on interesting problems, except with a lot more writing.\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\nLucky or smart?\n2019 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2010/11/a-surprising-thing-about-graduate-school/"}

When are businesses going to get it in their heads that people like things to be predictable.\u00a0 Life is already incredibly uncertain, they don\u2019t want your product or service to make it worse!\n\n\nCase in point: the \nTTC\n.\u00a0 I used to hate taking the TTC.\u00a0 I would wait, and wait, and wait, and then wait some more, not having any idea how long it would take for the next streetcar, bus or subway to arrive.\u00a0 Is this one of those delays that\u2019s going to take half an hour, or is it coming in the next minute?\u00a0 Am I going to be 10 minutes early or 10 minutes late?\u00a0 This used to drive me nuts!\u00a0 One reason I avoided most TTC surface vehicles like the plague, was that they were just too unpredictable to get to where I wanted to go in time.\u00a0 After many, many years, they\u2019ve finally figured out that they can improve their service by just providing more information.\n\n\nHere\u2019s an example of something that was seemingly insignificant relating to the construction at Spadina station.\u00a0 If you\u2019ve been there recently, there are holes in the wall, parts of the ceiling uncovered and just an unpleasant site in general.\u00a0 What would be ideal is to fix all those problems right away and make the station all shiny and new.\u00a0 Of course the probability of that happening is extremely unlikely (read: nil), so what else could they do?\u00a0 (Hint: give more information)\u00a0 And surprisingly, that\u2019s what happened!\u00a0 They simply put up a sign explaining that they are ensuring structural integrity of the building (or something along those lines) and they expect it to be fixed by a certain date (whether they can deliver is another story).\u00a0 These simple little signs, which is on every one of those little \u201cimprovement\u201d sites, really allowed me to cut them some slack because the integrity and safety of the building is much more important than an unsightly view.\n\n\nAnother example is the arrival times of the subways and streetcars.\u00a0 Now when I take one, I can look at the number and even if it\u2019s longer than I wanted to wait, I can plan.\u00a0 Just the other day, I came out of my Toastmaster\u2019s meeting with that distinct feeling of needing to relieve myself.\u00a0 Not being that urgent and not having any washrooms close by, I decided that I could wait until I got home.\u00a0 After arriving at the streetcar stop, I sent a text to the TTC\u2019s number to figure out how long I would be waiting.\u00a0 It quickly replied that it would take 10 minutes.\u00a0 At this point, my bladder was screaming that I wouldn\u2019t make it home.\u00a0 But knowing it was 10 minutes, I quickly hopped across the street, used the washroom, and was back in time to catch the streetcar.\u00a0 The alternative was waiting at the stop for what would have seemed like an eternity with the possibility of peeing myself.\u00a0 Thank goodness for arrival times!\n\n\nAlthough I\u2019m still resentful that the TTC didn\u2019t have these services earlier, it\u2019s better late than never.\u00a0 Some businesses (and people) still can\u2019t get it into their thick skulls that we just want to have some certainty in their lives.\u00a0 Even if the outcome isn\u2019t what we were hoping for, we can take time to process it and move on.\u00a0 Don\u2019t underestimate the power of giving people certainty because kingdoms, businesses and people have risen and fallen on this one point.\u00a0 (Corollary: If you can thrive in a environment of uncertainty, then you\u2019re a valuable asset wherever you go.)\u00a0 And if you can figure out how to do this, then you\u2019ll be rewarded with a lot more than just a badly needed washroom break.\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2017 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2010/09/uncertainty/"}

This is the  only significant financial investment that has two functions. Things  like cars and boats always go down in value, so most of the time, if  you\u2019re investing, you\u2019re doing it in something that you don\u2019t have to  fix, water, fuel or live in. You shouldn\u2019t fall in love with a bond or a  stock or a piece of gold, because if you do, you won\u2019t be a smart  investor. The problem (as people who sell and fix and build houses  understand) is that you just might fall in love with a house.

But I have a good reason and it\u2019s simple, I get email. Not a lot of email but just enough.\u00a0 Enough to know that a data plan would decrease my productivity.\u00a0 Let me explain.\n\n\nOn any given day I usually have between 6-12 hours where I can do work.\u00a0 This includes coding, reading papers, writing papers or miscellaneous work (TA, course work, supervising undergrads etc.).\u00a0 Now this sounds like a lot but it really isn\u2019t.\u00a0 And the reason is you can\u2019t get any meaningful work done unless you have at least a two hour block of time (although \nsome\n would argue 45 mins. but I think that applies more to meetings).\u00a0 Think about it.\u00a0 To sit down, get into the right mind set (i.e. context switch), remember where you left off so that you\u2019re ready to do some kind of efficient work on that task takes at least half a hour.\u00a0 Put in another hour of real work then add 30 mins. for bad estimations (because things always take longer than you expect) and two hours is up already.\n\n\nThis is of course a lower bound on that block of time you need.\u00a0 For coding or writing papers, I like to reserve at least 4 hours.\u00a0 So what\u2019s the problem some may ask, 4 is less than 6 right?\u00a0 Wrong.\u00a0 Like most real world problems, there are frictions.\u00a0 Things like meetings, chatting with peers, noisy environments, meals and you guessed it email.\n\n\nI get somewhere between 10 and 40 emails a day.\u00a0 And if I had a data plan then for every email I get, my phone would make a cute little sound and starts flashing this tiny little red light.\u00a0 As soon as I hear that sound or catch a glimpse of that flashing diode, I\u2019m distracted and there goes my continuous chunk of time.\u00a0 All of a sudden a 12 hour block of time gets divided into 10 different pieces and my productivity goes down the drain.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t a new realization either, it\u2019s \nwell documented\n that these minor distractions bring down efficiency (reading is great isn\u2019t it?) like a gentle breeze across a house of cards.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know about you but I like to be productive and that\u2019s why my name is Brian, I have a blackberry and I don\u2019t have a data plan.\n\n\nP.S. I realize it\u2019s possible to get a data plan and not have push email capabilities but I feel like it\u2019s a waste of money to get a data plan and then not take advantage of one of the major features.\u00a0 Plus, I think I\u2019d have a hard time explaining to people my reasoning.\u00a0 It\u2019s just easier for now to not have a data plan.\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\n2021 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2009/12/data-plans/"}

{"title": "History", "content": "History\n\t\t\n\u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it does rhyme.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Mark Twain\n\n\nOne of the great triumphs of man is when he first discovered the invention of \nwriting\n.  It\u2019s probably one of the most underrated inventions that is taken for granted by the majority of people.  Not only because it\u2019s used on a daily basis by practically everyone in society but because it\u2019s not used to its full potential.  \nSome\n have figured out its power, possibly the most successful ones, but definitely not the majority.  And the argument of why writing is so powerful is not very difficult to understand.\n\n\nDespite what some may have you believe, humans are just another kind of animal.  Special perhaps but still just animals.  One of the ways we learn is through experience.  We do something, it\u2019s beneficial, we keep doing it.  We do something else, it\u2019s detrimental, we stop doing it.  Over our lifetime, we fill our brain with our cumulative experiences and it guides our actions.  However, our life has to end sometime.  We only have a \nfinite\n lifespan so we can only accumulate a lifetime\u2019s worth of experiences to guide our actions.  So one would expect our knowledge to be limited to a lifetime\u2019s worth of experiences.  But it\u2019s not.  The invention of writing allows us to pick and choose from over 6000 years of human knowledge.  We are not limited by the experiences of just one lifetime, but limited by the amount you can learn in one lifetime.  There\u2019s a big difference.\n\n\nWhich brings me to my thoughts on the recent financial crisis.  Many claim it was a fluke, a one in a hundred year event.  It shouldn\u2019t have happened.  But it did.  And it was predictable because something very similar happened before.  Roger Lowenstein documented it clearly in his book \u201cWhen Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management\u201d.  In 1998, Long-Term Capital Management, with their mathematical models and leveraged portfolios, jeopardized the stability of the entire financial system.  Take this quote:\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the Long-Term episode proved anything, it is that the system of disclosure that has worked so well with regard to traditional securities has not be able to do the job with respect to derivative contracts\u2026 As the use of derivatives grows, this deficiency will return to haunt us.\u201d\n\n\n\nSound familiar?  This book was written in 2000.  I sometimes think that it\u2019s wishful thinking to think that things could have turned out differently.  Take a bunch of smart young grads, throw them on a trading floor, and show them how to make lots of money.  They\u2019re not going to care what the derivative contract represents or whether liquidity will always be this good, they\u2019re just going to keep making money.  Unfortunately, the same thing is probably going to happen again and it\u2019ll be another one of those once in a hundred year events, only 10 years after the last one.\n\n\nWe\u2019ve figured out how to learn from those before us, now only if we\u2019d do it.\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2017 Year-In-Review\nLessons From A Pandemic\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2009/08/history/"}
{"title": "Models", "content": "Models\n\t\t\nYou quietly stash a few blunt items away.  They\u2019ll be back and in bigger numbers.  Who knows why they don\u2019t make their move?  They just keep coming, day after day, atop their high walls, gawking.  But you have a plan.  These precious items will scare them off.  You\u2019ve made sure they haven\u2019t seen you storing them.  Every item, carefully hidden just out of their sight.  You wait\u2026 and wait\u2026 and wait until the one day you\u2019ve decided, it\u2019s time.  You pick up that big rock and hurl it at the closest target.  Then another, and another.  They run away screaming.  You feel an overwhelming sense of self worth.  You were right, you\u2019re plan worked!  Until you realize, you were wrong because, as it turns out, you\u2019re just an angry \nchimp\n.\n\n\nDarwin\n tells us that we\u2019ve come far since our ancestral chimpanzees cousins but I think we still have a long way to go.  One of the distinguishing features we have over lesser animals is the ability to plan ahead and predict the future.  Our brains have evolved to be able to simulate complex scenarios of possible futures to aid us in making decisions today.  This probably worked well when we were competing with other Hominids for survival but it doesn\u2019t work so well when trying to deal with complex systems with millions of variables.  This is especially true when we talk about systems such as the economy.\n\n\nOur brains can\u2019t handle all the input that\u2019s available to us, so in the face of these complex systems, we\u2019ve developed models to represent how things work.  These are abstractions of the physical world that are easier to understand with the aim of being useful.  However with the accumulation of human knowledge, these models have gotten so complicated that a PhD is sometimes a prerequisite for using these model.  With all the carefully calculated equations, we come out with a result and proclaim that it must be true if only for the fact that it\u2019s so complicated.  Except that it isn\u2019t.  \n\n\nOne of the most fundamental parts of using any model is understanding its assumptions and limitations. Despite this fundamental idea, \u201cexperts\u201d (perhaps with PhDs) will try to convince you otherwise, saying that they\u2019re models are right without stating the most important parts \u2014 the assumptions and limitations.  This idea isn\u2019t too complicated, a simple example of a model is saying that if it\u2019s cloudy then it\u2019s going to rain.  Of course this isn\u2019t always true, but why then do we believe experts when they say it\u2019s going to rain?\n\n\nThis brings us back to the economy.  Everyone from the \ngovernor of the Bank of Canada\n, a \nfamed economic historian\n and even the guy sitting next to me on the bus has an opinion on where this economy is heading.  Each one is using some model of how they think the economy works \u2014 some more researched than others.  No matter what model they use, no matter how many variables they take into account, they\u2019re still missing a fundamental point that can\u2019t be stressed enough: their model can\u2019t predict the future of something so complicated.\n\n\nIf we could predict the future with any reasonable sense of accuracy, we wouldn\u2019t be in this mess in the first place.  Be skeptical of someone who claims they can. If they could predict something even moderately useful with even the slightest sense of accuracy, they\u2019d be rich.  It\u2019s no wonder the \nrichest\n know enough to only use models within their limitations.\n\n\nModels aren\u2019t useless.  They help us simplify the world so that we can wrap our minds around it.  We just have to understand their limitations and when they should be used, like the old saying goes \u201cthe map is not the territory\u201d.  I don\u2019t think we\u2019re as far off from chimpanzees as we\u2019d like to believe but I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve moved beyond throwing rocks and not stepped backward to throwing something less pleasant.\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2022 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2009/04/models/"}
{"title": "Better not read", "content": "Better not read\n\t\t\n If you believe everything you read, better not read.\n\n\u2014 Japanese Proverb\n\n\nThe Japanese figured it out a long time ago but I think it\u2019s a lesson forgotten by most.  Millions of people around the world flock to news sources to find out about current events.  Whether it be about a remote village in Africa, the financial turmoil of America or what Jennifer Aniston is currently eating, there\u2019s an implicit trust.  A trust that the information they are getting is fair and unbiased.\n\n\nSome people \u2014 unfortunately, not most \u2014 have figured out that some news sources are more trustworthy than others.  It\u2019s more than a simply dichotomy of news sites and gossip magazines.  Some people have figured out that so called \u201cnews networks\u201d aren\u2019t really delivering news, they\u2019re delivering entertainment.\n\n\nIf we stop looking at what \u201cnews networks\u201d are telling us and look at what they want from us, it\u2019s very enlightening.  Do the news sources want to give us fair and unbiased news, inform us about current events from around the world, and give a detailed analysis so we can understand the events within the context of our lives?  Maybe.  Do they want to make money?  Definitely.  And there\u2019s the rub.  They make money, not by the reliability of their news, but by how many people are viewing it.  How can they get more people to watch it?  Make it more interesting \u2014 even if it twists the truth to make it more entertaining.\n\n\nThis irks me, especially when it presents a poor image about people whom I respect.  The average reader will pick up the paper, read a story and believe it to be true.  Why?  Because of the implicit trust.  \n\n\nThey did it to Alan Greenspan last fall when he presented his testimony to congress and they\u2019re doing it now with Warren Buffet (\n\u201cBuffett admits mistakes in annual Berkshire letter\u201d\n).  I just read Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s most recent \nshareholder letter\n and all the things they said in the article are true \u2014 except they\u2019re not.  The title is already misleading implying that the main subject of the share holder letter was Buffett\u2019s mistakes, which is clearly wasn\u2019t.  The article also quotes parts of his shareholder letter to find fault in Buffett.  Clearly, this wasn\u2019t the most important point of his shareholder letter.  The article can be summed up as Buffet made a couple of mistakes.  However, this is taken out of context where his wildly successful investment decisions along with his very candid communication to shareholders do not come into play.\n\n\nI\u2019ve come to abhor entertainment posing as news.  There\u2019s room for news as entertainment \u2014 just don\u2019t pretend it\u2019s anything else.  I\u2019ve come to learn that if I really want to learn about a subject, I\u2019ll dive straight into the primary sources instead of looking through the second-hand rosy coloured glass that most modern news sources put on.  I advise everyone to do the same, otherwise, better not read.\n\n\nRelated Posts:\nBook Impressions -- 2019-Q2\n2021 Year-In-Review\n2018 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2009/03/better-not-read/"}
{"title": "Passion", "content": "Passion\n\t\t\nI\u2019m lucky.  I\u2019ve known what I\u2019m passionate about for quite some time.  It probably started back in grade seven when I first started playing \nWarcraft 2\n on my 486.  The mystery about how a curious little box could bring me so much joy \u2014 hours upon hours on end \u2014 playing a simple computer game was baffling.  But it didn\u2019t stop at computer games.  I would poke around this little box tweaking, fiddling, trying to figure out what everything did.  Pulling out hardware and putting it back.  Even formatting the hard drive for no good reason (to my brother\u2019s dismay).\n\n\nI\u2019m also lucky for another reason: my mother.  She saw this sudden interest in computers and wanted to cultivate it.  So she hired an undergrad from York University to teach me about computers.  Interestingly, my computer teacher didn\u2019t really know what to teach me at first.  He first asked about DOS, knew it.  Then about HTML, knew it.  Finally about hardware and how to install it.  There I learned something new.  There\u2019s a strange sense of freedom when you figure out how to change your first hard drive.  Being unbound from the shackles of the computer store technician whose motives all too often resembled that of an uncaring used car salesman is liberating.  However, you can only teach someone about how to install a hard drive or a ISA card for so long.  My newly hired computer teacher needed something more to teach me \u2014 lest he lose his newly needed source of income.  Here began my first foray in programming.\n\n\nI must admit, I wasn\u2019t a great programmer at first.  I didn\u2019t understand all the concepts.  Functions, sorting, recursion was all a wonderful blur that I didn\u2019t quite understand, although I was only in grade seven.  I remember the first program I wrote in Pascal was a simple little hundred-liner that printed \u201c*\u201d across the screen in a triangle pattern.  When I showed my mom, she wasn\u2019t nearly as excited as I was \u2014 although I\u2019m sure she, nor I, realized the magnitude of the event.  I think that\u2019s when I first developed a passion for computers.\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard for people who aren\u2019t as lucky as me.  Finding a passion for something is difficult.  However, I recently came across a web page from my former professor \nLarry Smith\n who talks about \u201ccareer development\u201d.  I feel obligated to advise anyone who still hasn\u2019t found their passion to follow the \nwisdom\n of successful people before them.  I list the first four principles here:\n\n\n\n\nYou have passion for your work.\n\n\nIn order to prepare for your work, you enjoy your studies.\n\n\nIf you have not yet found your passion, you keep looking.\n\n\nFinding your passion and choosing your career takes great care and thought.\n\n\n\n\nI like to share my wisdom as most people do, including some very \nsuccessful\n people.  One thing I always stress is to be passionate about something.  However, many that I talk to, have not found their passion yet.  I usually don\u2019t have a useful response, I\u2019ve liked (and have been good at) computers for almost as long as I can remember.  This usually doesn\u2019t help them.  However, reading what Larry has to say about it really clicked with me.  Finding your passion isn\u2019t easy.  Nor should it be.  Like most good thing in life, it takes hard work.  Those who aren\u2019t prepared to work for it, don\u2019t deserve to reap the benefits.  I\u2019m lucky.  I\u2019ve found my passion.  I work hard everyday, not because I must, but because I can.\n\n\nRelated Posts:\nPassion is Not Linear\nLuck or Passion?\n2019 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2009/02/passion/"}
{"title": "The One", "content": "The One\n\t\t\nUniversity is supposed to be one of those life changing experiences.  You come in a scared ignorant youth and walk out a confident worldly adult \u2014 at least that\u2019s what we\u2019d all like to believe.  Change is inevitable and despite Hollywood movies where this process happens in the span of a fifteen minute montage, this change is usually more gradual, somewhere on the order of years.  However, growing up with popular culture in my head, I\u2019ve always felt that there was one thing missing from my education \u2014 the one.  The one teacher who changes the way you look at the world.  The one teacher who makes you consider possibilities that you\u2019ve only imagined.  The one teacher who changes you from an ignorant youth to a confident adult.\n\n\nI\u2019m sad to say that I haven\u2019t had that experience, although there\u2019s always hope (\nPhD\n here I come).  However, if there was any professor who came close, it was \nLarry Smith\n (link intended for the exclusive use of Larry Smith\u2019s current and former students).  Strangely enough (or maybe not at all), he wasn\u2019t an engineering professor; he taught economics.  His classes in micro- and macroeconomics  (\nECON 101/102\n) are infamous for his animated story telling, in your face lecturing style and surprisingly useful real-world applications of economics.  If I had to give any UW student advice, it\u2019s to take his course.\n\n\nHis lectures have mass appeal because of the sheer entertainment value he gives running up and down the aisles, shouting in people\u2019s faces, and stealing snacks from unsuspecting students.  The numbers don\u2019t lie \u2014 every semester he has the biggest lecture room in DC filled with students sitting up and down the aisles.  Besides his obvious entertaining lecturing style, the main reason I like his lectures is that he goes into great length about two topics I find every interesting \u2014 success and money.\n\n\nThere are a surprisingly large number of useful things that the education system doesn\u2019t teach you \u2014 but Larry Smith does.  I did go into university an ignorant youth, I didn\u2019t come out a worldly adult \u2014 just a bit less ignorant.  And a large part of that was because of his lectures.  Maybe I don\u2019t give him enough credit.  I think the only thing I can do to show my gratitude is to become one of the \u201cspies\u201d.  And if he really does have \u201cspies\u201d everywhere like he claims, it\u2019s a real testament to his abilities as a teacher.  Thanks Larry Smith!\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n2018 Year-In-Review\n2017 Year-In-Review\n2019 Year-In-Review\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\t", "url": "https://briankeng.com/2009/02/the-one/"}
